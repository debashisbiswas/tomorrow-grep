00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440
 This guy was supposedly getting hints via vibrating anal beads.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.720
 - I'm sorry, what now? - Yes.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.800
 - Anal beads. - Yes.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.640
 - Via anal beads. - Yes.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.240
 - Anal beads, of course. - Yes.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.760
 - Can we go back to the anal beads? - Yes.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.080
 - I came in at anal beads and left at anal beads, so.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.240
 - Anal beads? Yes.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:44.120
 - Matt was a voice teacher.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.960
 - Yeah. - How do you,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.240
 what's the term for that?

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.400
 I botched that really badly.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.480
 - There's loads, I was. - Okay.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.920
 - Technically I was a few different things.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.160
 I was like a singing teacher and a voice coach

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.000
 and an acting coach and a public speaking coach.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.680
 So all sorts of bits. - Wow, yeah.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.520
 - It's not the same gear, basically, so you can kind of

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.240
 blag your way into any chubby fancy.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.360
 It was great fun, yeah, I did that for like six years.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.360
 - The one that stood out a lot there was the accent coach.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.840
 Like you would teach people how to have

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.160
 a fake British accent or any accent.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.560
 - It was, so I was contracted for, for example,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.240
 at a drama school where I taught people how to do

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.680
 an American accent for like six months or something.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.880
 - That is amazing.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.680
 - Isn't that crazy, a general American accent?

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.040
 - Can you do an American accent right now?

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.040
 - Can you do one?

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.440
 - I can do one, yeah, of course.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.440
 - Well, it's been a long time, oh no, I can't do it, man.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.120
 I can't do it.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.440
 - Oh, man, it's been way too long.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.280
 - It's been way too long.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.840
 You can look though, there's a whole,

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.560
 I've got a whole YouTube channel

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.280
 of me teaching different accents.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.560
 - This is amazing.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.920
 I can't believe I've ever seen this.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.560
 - So I taught a Brooklyn accent, like a Scottish accent,

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.440
 a friend, I mean they're all terrible, you know,

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.040
 like I look by now, it's just like, you know what I'm saying?

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.680
 Like if you look back at yourself, you don't feel embarrassed,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.840
 you know, you haven't grown.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.240
 So that's like a living proof of that.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.240
 But it was crazy actually,

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.840
 'cause when I was doing my YouTube stuff,

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.080
 I was having to do, I was having to battle

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.200
 against my old channel, which was also Matt Pocock.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.680
 So having to do SEO against myself from his career,

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.240
 which is bizarre, yeah.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.960
 - Could you maybe throw in some like Scottish

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.480
 or Brooklyn accents into some TypeScript content?

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.320
 That would be amazing.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.040
 You just merge the two worlds.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.160
 - When I did more streaming, I used to, you know,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.920
 just, I don't know, knock out a Liverpool accent

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.680
 or something while I was going.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.800
 I can still do this one, this one's locked in, you know?

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.280
 I guess you probably don't know this accent too much to you,

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.120
 'cause it's like--

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.440
 - I've watched a lot of British media, so, I know.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.160
 - What was that one?

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.560
 - This is Liverpool.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.400
 - Liverpool?

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.240
 - Oh, it's close.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.680
 - It's close to Ireland, actually,

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.920
 it's just over the Irish sea, but, yeah.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.480
 - Okay, that is that in the UK?

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.640
 It's all the same to me, I guess.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.480
 If it's British, it's just to be careful.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.320
 - Ireland--

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.720
 - But it does sound different than your voice.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.560
 - Thank you.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.400
 - I don't know.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.120
 (laughing)

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.960
 - I don't know.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:00.800
 - I can definitely tell you--

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.640
 - You're doing something.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.480
 - You're doing something.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.320
 (laughing)

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.160
 - That's all I get.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.000
 It sounds differently in a more voice.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.200
 - Wait, so how did you learn all these accents?

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.840
 Do you just watch TV?

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.760
 - My history with it is, if you wanna get really deep,

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.960
 which is I started as like, it was like my first job,

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.240
 basically, out of university, was I was,

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.600
 my friend basically had a web business

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.800
 where he would sit on all these domain names,

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.360
 like singing lessons Belfast or singing lessons Exeter or whatever.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.000
 And he said, right, I've got this domain

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.400
 that's like number one for this keyword.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.960
 Could you take some singing lessons?

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.160
 'Cause I was a singer and I sort of knew what I was doing,

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.840
 but I'd never taught a singing lesson before.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.080
 I never actually had a singing lesson before.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.920
 And so I just thought, oh yeah, okay, I'm gonna have to give this a go.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.480
 And I just fell in love with it, basically.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.480
 I was so addicted, and that was straight out of university.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.120
 I did that for six years.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.640
 And I was kind of, you just, I just learned it out of books.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.200
 And when I got singing, training myself and gots,

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.680
 I then did this Masters at Guilford School of Acting,

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.600
 which is like a proper drama school,

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.440
 which was a super weird experience.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.400
 You could imagine like, the drama on Tech Twitter is nothing compared

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.040
 to the calls about actual drama school.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.080
 Yeah, it was quite a good preparation, actually.

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.920
 - Yeah, and then for the year of that,

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.080
 I moved to London and worked in some various drama schools and stuff.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.920
 And then my way of getting into Tech was actually like,

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.640
 I was absolutely sick of London.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.480
 I hated it.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.960
 I wanted to move back to the countryside,

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.880
 which is kind of where I'm from.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.680
 And so I thought, what's a good skill that I can learn?

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.480
 I've got a bit of free time because I was teaching singing lessons.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.480
 I had gaps in the day.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.360
 What's the skill that I can learn that I can do from anywhere

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.560
 that will mean I can move to the countryside

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.520
 and still in a decent wage?

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.360
 And that was Tech.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.200
 - I know here I am.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.040
 - Wow.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.920
 Yeah, it's wild to think of you not being in Tech.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.320
 You talk about the voice lessons and all that stuff.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.120
 I've heard you talk about it, but I just assumed

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.520
 you did it on the side of your Tech career.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.120
 - That was the whole, that was the dream.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.840
 That was like, wanting to be one of the best singing teachers in the world,

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.720
 if I could, and like, make it happen.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.600
 But you just had to live in London, really.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.800
 Because that's where all the drama schools are,

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.000
 that's where all the clients are, that's where everything is.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.280
 So, or New York or whatever, but you know, I never want to live in America.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.760
 - Fair, totally fair.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.080
 How much is there like a, does it rhyme in terms of teaching

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.440
 all the things you used to teach and teaching TypeScript or other Tech things?

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.080
 Does it feel like there's a lot in common there or is it just totally different?

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.240
 - It feels completely similar.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.280
 And it really felt like, so I was an engineer for, you know, five years or so

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.440
 before I moved into this, and, which is not, not a terribly long time,

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.440
 but when I started doing it, it just felt like, I see all the pieces are coming together.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.960
 I got this long kind of teaching background and then this sort of tech background

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.240
 and now, boom, all together, feels good, feels really good.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.120
 - So, your whole tech career, that was fully remote then.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.480
 So you just like, get a job and then just move out as soon as you could?

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.480
 - Well, I did a bit of, I did quite a lot of start-up hopping, basically.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:20.600
 So my first job I had was actually in person, in Oxfordshire, which is where I live.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.480
 And that folded after about five months, through no fault of my own,

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.720
 I think the company just ran out of money, basically.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.040
 And then I moved to an agency and was mostly remote and somewhere else that was mostly remote.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.960
 So, yeah, and, because I was working from home when I was a singing teacher as well,

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:44.280
 mostly, I've been working from home for, well, since like 2012 or something, like crazy.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.440
 - Yeah, I love it, though. - It's wild to me.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.600
 I'm still stuck on the whole, you've just grew in tech for five years.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.440
 Like, that's encouraging for anybody that wants to be like the best at a thing,

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.440
 because you're like the TypeScript guy.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.880
 - Yeah. - And I just assumed like,

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.480
 you're like those soccer players that were like born on the soccer field,

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.600
 that you like were born in the depths of TypeScript somehow,

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.440
 and you've been doing it for your entire life.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.960
 But like the fact that, max, you've been doing TypeScript for five years,

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.040
 and you're like the TypeScript expert, that's pretty wild and encouraging.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:19.560
 - Yeah, it's odd for me, you know, it's not a position that I expected to find myself in.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:24.440
 I think if you're good at communicating things,

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:28.040
 often I find that the best engineers out there are actually just the best communicators,

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.400
 you know what I mean? The best at bringing people into their world view,

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:36.440
 the best at writing PR descriptions, the best at kind of just smoothly communicating their code.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.760
 You know, so it always felt quite linked to me in that way.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:45.320
 - It's also funny that the bar is also like pretty low.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.520
 I mean, I'm not trying to, I'm not just coming off as insults, but.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:55.320
 - From DAX, I mean, it's coming off as genuine insult.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:03.480
 But like, I think what I found is, I think people in our field are so especially bad at that stuff.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.600
 So even if you're just slightly, if you feel like any like slight amount of attention,

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.080
 it starts to really go up.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:14.120
 - It felt like an astonishing advantage when I started being in tech, you know what I mean?

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.640
 I would be in these meetings and often go to interviews as well,

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.840
 that I had no business getting actually, and would just walk it, you know,

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:25.720
 because I could actually just talk my way through a full sentence, you know what I mean?

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:26.120
 - Yeah.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:30.280
 - Which is, I just not something that people tend to prize, you know,

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.840
 I think we have this idea of the 10x engineer that just kind of sits in code in their brain all day

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:43.560
 and then spurts out binary, and then like, that's our model for how like the genius weirdo, you know,

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:48.200
 whereas, I don't know, I think you can be much more competitive by improving your communication.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:48.600
 - Absolutely.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:55.080
 - I'm realizing I've had this belief as well, and I'm just not good at like articulating these things.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.280
 - Yeah, that's fine.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.280
 - And anyone who, it's like your book.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:03.000
 - Anyone who listens to this podcast, no, not the best communicator.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.560
 But I have been really good at like sales in terms of software stuff.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.120
 Like when I was freelance, when I was in consulting,

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:14.440
 I always felt like I could get on a call with a potential client and win that work.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:19.480
 Like I would get some kind of work in relationship with this person just from like getting on a call with them.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:23.720
 So I don't know if that's communication or if it's something else, personality or I don't know.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.920
 There's something there that I've always felt like, I'm not that good at programming,

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.800
 but I seem to do pretty well at this one thing.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.800
 So I do think it makes sense in my brain.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:32.840
 - Yeah.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:36.440
 - I think most of what being a programmer is is not programming.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.080
 You know, it's all the stuff around the edges.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:43.400
 And it's the stuff around the edges that is where most of the value is, I think.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.080
 Not actually writing the code.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.640
 - Yeah, it's like it's both me and Adam.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:52.200
 And it sounds like you also spend a lot of time as consultants, just like on our own.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:58.440
 And you'll often see a threat on hacker news or somewhere where someone posts something like,

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.480
 "Hey, I'm interested in going freelance, how do I do this?"

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:07.080
 And you can tell that it seems like such an impossible mystery to them.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.680
 Like, how do you possibly do this?

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:14.680
 And all the replies people are actually talking about how difficult or like impossible it is kind of.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:21.560
 But it's funny because if I look back on how I actually did it, it's like the stupidest,

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:22.600
 most straightforward thing ever.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:27.400
 Like you spend time, find one connection, do a good job.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.800
 Then we find another connection.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.880
 And then find another connection.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:35.240
 And that first connection comes back to you a year later being like,

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.520
 "Hey, I remember you did a good job.

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.200
 Let's like do more stuff together."

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.320
 Over time, if you build good relations with people, it just starts to compound.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.680
 It's very, very straightforward.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:46.440
 But I just see people talk about getting into it.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.120
 It just seems like an impossible mystery.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.560
 - And I imagine it feels quite insecure for people who haven't done it before as well.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:55.160
 Full disclosure, I haven't done that much self-employed stuff.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.200
 I've mostly been employed and then doing courses.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:02.120
 But I was self-employed as a single teacher because before that.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:07.080
 And it's all about the amount of repeated streams of income

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.600
 and the more you have, the more they hedge against each other.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.640
 Because it's often like, "You're self-employed.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:18.200
 How can that possibly, that must feel so insecure as an income stream?"

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.840
 But if you've got seven different clients that you work for sporadically,

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:25.960
 if one goes, you just find another one, it's the most secure kind of income.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.160
 - Yeah, I agree.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.040
 It really is.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:32.200
 Yeah, I was just going to say, it always felt so hard to leave.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.240
 Because a couple of times in my career, I've left a stable,

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.760
 you just get paid job and gone on my own.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:42.920
 It's always so scary that first leap, and then once you do it,

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.400
 you realize it's actually the ceiling's just so much higher

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.200
 and you never end up making less than you did.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:52.280
 It's just like, it's better in all the ways, but it is scary.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.920
 Especially if it's your first time, I would imagine.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:58.600
 - Yeah. - I'm curious, though, because I was

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.000
 self-employed for six years and then I got a full-time job,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.560
 which was my first full-time job I've ever had, first 9 to 5.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:10.920
 And what I noticed was I would rock up in the morning and slowly over time,

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.960
 this little kind of ticking clock that was in my brain,

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.160
 that had been since I was 21, just disappeared.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:22.600
 I was like, "I no longer need to think I can take holiday."

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:27.000
 And they would pay me for not doing any work.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.400
 You know what I mean? How amazing is that?

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:34.520
 And that little anxiety just sort of went away and I just felt free.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:38.920
 And I think it's there again, because I'm back self-employed now.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:39.800
 I think it's back there.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:44.760
 But I can't tell, and I won't be able to tell until I get a full-time job again.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.280
 - Yeah. - Is this something you guys feel?

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.800
 - 100%. It's totally there.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:52.760
 And I think it shows up in very practical ways where if you're someone that builds

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:57.160
 by like the week or by the hour, whatever it is, so you won't go on vacation.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.240
 Okay, your vacation costs $2,000.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:03.000
 And it also costs like the five grand you're not going to make that week.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.160
 So I really just become like, even if you're not explicitly thinking about it,

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.320
 like there's just friction to all of those things.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:13.240
 So yeah, definitely it feels like when things always go,

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.600
 you're always like juggling.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.360
 There's a good juggler in your head, basically.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.560
 That's what it feels like for me.

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:21.640
 - But I've only had one of those real jobs that you mentioned.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.320
 And I would say during that period, it was very...

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:29.320
 Like I went into it thinking this is going to be like vacation.

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.600
 I've never like just had a job where I just clocking clock out, get paid.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.400
 But like I still had all the side projects.

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.480
 I didn't actually drop all the other stuff.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.080
 It's like I still tried to fit it all in.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.520
 It just got more stressful.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:45.160
 So I think for some people, you just can't turn off that itch to do your own thing.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:49.480
 And if you try to work at a normal job, you just end up doing it all and it sucks.

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:50.680
 That's how it worked for me.

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.160
 I guess maybe that's like a once-in-a-lifetime thing for me then,

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.240
 because I was coming off being a singing teacher.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.640
 And it's not like I could, you know,

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.080
 because I moved to a totally different place.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.880
 Not like I could like do my singing teaching in London on Sunday.

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:02.520
 - Yeah, sure, yeah.

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.080
 - So it was just, oh, it was lovely though.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.440
 I recommend it though.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:10.200
 Just move to a different side of the world and, you know.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:10.840
 - Yeah, there you go.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:11.720
 - Give up all your side projects.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:12.840
 - This connector and everything.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:13.880
 You have no eye on it.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:17.240
 I guess when I had a baby, I think fraternity leaves both times.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:20.120
 That was probably the only time in my career I felt really unplugged.

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.400
 You just can't do that, right, Matt?

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:25.720
 - So I, yeah, my baby was literally teething like

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:29.800
 five, 15 minutes ago screaming in the house up there.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:33.400
 And yeah, he was born in January.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:40.360
 And it's been surreal because I sell courses now.

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.560
 People will buy the courses,

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:45.160
 whether I'm working or not, you know, which is amazing.

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.200
 It's the closest I've felt.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.200
 It's kind of like passive income, you know.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.760
 And so for the last like five months or so,

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:54.200
 I've been working maybe eight hours a week or something.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.400
 It's been so good.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:55.960
 - Wow.

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.000
 - It's just the animal baby.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:57.800
 It's been--

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:58.840
 - It's the dream, man.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:14:59.720
 - It's been amazing.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.760
 It's been amazing.

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.280
 - Is that your dream, Dax?

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:03.400
 You're not a normal human being.

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.440
 Is that your dream?

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.640
 - That does sound really nice.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:06.040
 - It's not.

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.680
 - And I think, no, no, no, I think it is.

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:11.160
 I think that's like definitely what I'm working to for sure.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.000
 That's like what, that's like what I,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 it's a point of doing everything I'm doing now, I think.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.240
 - Yeah, I don't know what it'll be like

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:22.520
 if I actually get that, like maybe I'll like it for a bit

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:27.160
 and I'll go crazy, but I definitely need to be working.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.200
 But I don't think it needs to be like working on a baby.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.680
 It seems like it would still count, you know?

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.600
 - Working on it.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:39.400
 - I mean, it's kind of like, I like that way of saying it though,

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.320
 because it does feel like that, you know.

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:44.520
 When you're putting baby clothes on, it's sort of,

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.360
 it's like--

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.400
 - On the baby, now I do.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:52.200
 - It's like, it's like, thank you, thank you.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.320
 Cause that's really--

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.480
 - I mean, we can see his hands.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.880
 He was like gesturing that there was a baby.

00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:58.680
 He was putting them on.

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:01.240
 But when you think about the sentence, it is kind of--

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.600
 - When you're putting baby clothes on.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.960
 - When you're putting baby clothes on.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.040
 - You're doing something that has,

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:10.040
 the fruits of your labor are immediately apparent, you know?

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:13.480
 I mean, you're very connected to the outcome of your work,

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:17.400
 which is just often not something you get when you're coding, you know?

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.360
 - Yeah, sort of do.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.960
 You know, you get a nice little dopamine feedback loop and stuff.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.520
 But yeah, and that's been great.

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:26.040
 So I thought I would be like, you, Dax,

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:30.120
 I thought I would be like, feeling the fever to work all of the time.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.440
 And I'm not, it's great.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:35.080
 - Yeah, I wonder, I've always wondered what my time frame is.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.560
 Like, at what point of having that kind of schedule,

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.760
 where it's like actually way less stuff going on?

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.920
 Like, is it six months, is it a year?

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.520
 I do think there's some point on the horizon

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:47.400
 where I would start feeling like I need to do something.

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:48.760
 - I think you're maybe worse than,

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:51.400
 I feel like this is more dangerous for you.

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:52.760
 I feel like, based on your personality.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.920
 - Yeah, I'm kind of, I'm a manic.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:55.240
 - Yeah.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.880
 - I'm hypo manic or something.

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:01.720
 I get a little like nuts, if I'm not outletting.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:02.680
 I don't know.

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:05.480
 But then I'll have weeks, like Casey goes away for a week.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.920
 She's at a volleyball camp right now.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.440
 And when I'm full-time dad,

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:10.520
 I feel like I can just channel my focus beam,

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.680
 like that intense thing that I do

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.160
 into like being the best possible dad.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:15.960
 And it's kind of fun.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.880
 Like it is like, it's a type of work.

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:18.760
 It's like the baby.

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:20.840
 It's like, it's not the same.

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:22.040
 It's totally different.

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.960
 But it's, there's all these ways you can min-max it.

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.800
 And you can like do these things to get ahead of stuff.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.040
 And you got the chores going, you got the kids going,

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.240
 you got everything.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.160
 It's like, you can still kind of do it.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.120
 It's interesting, in any area of life probably.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:37.240
 - Yeah, although I think it rewards your focus in that way.

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.960
 You know, it does actually reward the more you put into it,

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.200
 the more you get out of it in an odd way.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.880
 Kind of just like coding, just like work.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.880
 It rewards itself.

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:48.600
 - If we're not working towards slowing down at some point,

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:49.400
 then what are we doing?

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:51.240
 Like I hope that that comes.

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.560
 It's awesome, Matt, that you've gotten there.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.240
 Yeah, I don't know, my wife doesn't believe it.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.600
 She doesn't believe I'll ever slow down.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.480
 But I'd like to think I will someday.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:03.640
 - I think you have slowed down like 1% every year probably.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:07.160
 So I would imagine you probably passed like the worst.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.320
 - Probably just like, that's just getting old though, isn't it?

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.080
 - Yeah, getting more of a better taste.

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.200
 - Because that's your younger risk.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.000
 - I don't even know, Matt, how old you are, I guess.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.640
 I know DEX is like early 32.

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.200
 - I'm not that young.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:18.920
 - I'm 33.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:19.800
 - So I am older.

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.080
 I'm just getting slow 'cause I'm old.

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.440
 - I'm 37.

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:25.400
 I'm gonna be 38 this year, just a month or so.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.360
 - Wow.

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:27.720
 - Geez, yeah, I know.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:28.680
 - Geez.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.160
 - So you've all in 1986, is that right?

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.360
 - Yeah, '86.

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:37.400
 - I read a stat today that 1986 is the same distance

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:42.040
 apart from 2024 as it is to 1938.

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.880
 - Oh my god.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.560
 I hate when people do that.

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:46.920
 I hate when people pull that trick.

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.280
 - Oh, sorry dude.

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:52.120
 - It's like, to me, the 70s were 30 years ago.

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:53.080
 Always.

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:53.800
 - Yeah, I know.

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.160
 It's always gonna be 2000, yeah.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:56.280
 - 50 something years ago.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.480
 - That's like my completely mind blowing.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.120
 - Yeah.

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.800
 - I guess not every generation gets that.

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.720
 Like not every, not every generation kind of goes

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.880
 over the millennium boundary or whatever.

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.800
 - Yeah, but I feel like that's gotta be a phenomenon.

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.560
 - Yeah, like everything's oriented around that point

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:10.520
 in my head.

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:11.080
 - Uh-huh.

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:11.960
 - Yeah.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.960
 - That is crazy.

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:16.680
 But yeah, so I don't have any kids,

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:20.280
 but I think we probably, we're planning for that soon.

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.000
 Probably not a very similar timeline to you

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:23.960
 if you're older than me.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.440
 But yeah, we'll see.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.000
 - I don't think--

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:27.800
 - Check back in a year.

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:28.680
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.440
 - Can you break the news on the podcast, please?

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.800
 Sorry, continue.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.080
 - Give me back in.

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:33.400
 - No pressure.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.600
 - I'm just gonna be holding a baby.

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.200
 - I think that was a good one.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.360
 - That's actually what I want to do.

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.440
 I want to like not say anything at all

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:43.480
 and just completely drop it unannounced

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.880
 because I don't think I give off the vibe of someone

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:49.800
 that would have children or like would be seen with a baby.

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.600
 So you'll be like very shocking for people.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:57.240
 - I feel like you're a fatherly figure on tech Twitter.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.520
 You're just talking down to us all.

00:19:58.520 --> 00:19:59.960
 - I'm like a flaminar race.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.480
 - I'm like an immigrant fatherly figure.

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:01.800
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.880
 - So this is an important part of the DAX brand.

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:08.280
 It's like childless, available.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.880
 - Yeah, available.

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.720
 - Yeah, I'm not available.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:12.680
 No, no, no.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:13.720
 - I'm not available.

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.520
 - Wow, you know.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:17.320
 - Hopefully not.

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:18.280
 - There's nothing telling you down.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:21.480
 - Just a dog in a way.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:22.360
 - And as we've talked about before,

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.440
 you know, having a dog is exactly like a baby.

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.680
 It's exactly, basically the exact same thing.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:27.800
 - Exactly, yeah, yeah.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:30.920
 - I can't wait to have a baby so that I can be like,

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.520
 can now that I have a baby,

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:34.280
 I can confirm it's the exact same thing.

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:35.560
 And I'll just upset everyone.

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:37.960
 - So, yeah, so easy.

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:41.320
 - So what do you do for fun, Matt?

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.080
 Oh, sorry, you were going to ask an important question.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.160
 And I'm, oh, really?

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.040
 I just don't know much about you as a person, you know?

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.880
 - You live in the country, do you farm?

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:50.600
 Is that what you do?

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.520
 - I don't find, no.

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:54.520
 I don't, it's not that country.

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.680
 It's like, it's town, you know?

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.320
 It's town.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.240
 - Yeah, I grew up in a small town.

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:00.120
 - I grew up in a place like that too.

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.720
 - Like how many people are we talking?

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.960
 What is a small town in the countryside of the UK?

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:08.680
 - The town I grew up in was like 8,000 people, I think.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:09.720
 - Okay, yeah, we're--

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.880
 - This is, I think there's like 1,000 people here,

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.080
 500 people here.

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.080
 And then we're moving somewhere even smaller, actually.

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:15.640
 - Oh, really?

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.600
 You're trying to get away as far as you can from everyone.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.280
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:21.720
 - I'm all about that, Lesh.

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.880
 - Yeah, it's going to be great, man.

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.960
 We're moving to this place where it's just like,

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.640
 there's just beautiful walks all around.

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:28.760
 There's like some really rich people

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:29.800
 who just live up the hill.

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.960
 And so like the surrounding countryside

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.080
 basically can't be built on

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:34.200
 because it's going to spoil their views.

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.400
 So it's just kind of nice.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.200
 - Very nice.

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:37.000
 - I can't wait.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.600
 - I went to Europe for the first time in my life

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:41.080
 a couple of weeks ago, but what is it?

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.480
 So when you say you go and live in a house,

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:46.200
 is it like you have it backyard in a front yard?

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.520
 Or is it like, what's like the situation?

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:49.560
 Do you have like a property?

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:50.360
 Like do you have a forest?

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:51.560
 Like what's a deal?

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:57.080
 - No, we have a backyard, front yard of reasonable size.

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.720
 We don't like, it's not like we have peasants

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:00.840
 or surfs or anything.

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:05.320
 It's just like, it's just got a bit of land, basically.

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.120
 A plot.

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:09.640
 We don't have as much space as in the US, obviously.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:13.400
 So comes, it costs a pretty penny, as we say.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.520
 - Oh, it's just a big island.

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:15.320
 I didn't think about that.

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:16.680
 - What do you mean?

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.200
 Well, you guys are a big island, technically.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.640
 - Well, yeah, I guess everything's big.

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.600
 You really think about it.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.200
 - Yeah.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.160
 - There's water everywhere.

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:27.560
 But like, it's a smaller island than the US, right?

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.360
 Like, so space is premium, but there's countryside.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.520
 I mean, there's places where it's not super developed, right?

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:33.000
 - That's true.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.720
 But it's just like, there's just enough to squeeze

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:39.400
 into a postcard and, you know, for the brand.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.600
 And then it's kind of just stuff, apart from Scotland,

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:45.240
 where it's just, you know, deserts, basically.

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:45.640
 - Yeah.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:46.760
 - Or desolate area.

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:47.800
 - So how close is this?

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:48.440
 - It's desert in Scotland.

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.080
 - Oh, sorry.

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:49.880
 - How close is the next house?

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:50.680
 - I'll lick a PDF.

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.040
 - How close is the next house to you?

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:53.880
 Like are the houses like right next to each other?

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.480
 - Yeah, it's like semi-detached.

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.160
 So it's literally built.

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.680
 - Okay, that makes sense.

00:22:58.680 --> 00:22:59.240
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.920
 - Yeah, I mean, Miami is like very similar.

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:02.840
 Like I have a house with a front yard and a backyard,

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.240
 but it's obviously a city by a lot of space.

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:05.720
 - Yeah.

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:06.520
 - So the houses are next.

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:07.080
 - You're Miami.

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:07.560
 Wow.

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:07.880
 - Cool.

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.000
 - I was in New York for 10 years,

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.080
 and I moved to Miami three years ago.

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:11.560
 - Mm-hmm.

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:12.120
 - Yeah.

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.880
 Not the country, really.

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:14.600
 - Mm-hmm.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:15.400
 - More than the swamp.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.760
 (laughing)

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.040
 - I love the country.

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.920
 The Ozarks are kind of like the country in America, right?

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:21.560
 - Mm-hmm.

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:22.920
 - It's like the countryside.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.040
 I sit on two acres.

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:24.840
 - Yeah, I watch the show.

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:25.640
 - Yeah, show.

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:26.440
 - That's crazy.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:28.200
 Two acres.

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:28.760
 - I got all kinds of room.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:29.720
 You guys should move to the Ozarks.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.200
 - That's my only thing with the Ozarks.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.760
 That's all I know about the Ozarks is money laundering.

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:35.800
 - Before that, yeah.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.480
 Before that show, nobody knew anything.

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:39.320
 I never said the Ozarks before that show,

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:41.880
 because no one would know what that was.

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.160
 I've grown up in the Ozarks.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:46.040
 I knew what it was, but then Jason Bateman put us on the map.

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.320
 I get to say I'm from the Ozarks,

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:48.920
 and people are like, "Oh, drugs and stuff."

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:50.920
 - Oh, yeah, basically.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.680
 (laughing)

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.080
 - Cool, okay.

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:56.120
 - Yeah.

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:58.040
 - We never let you finish, so--

00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:58.840
 - Oh, yeah, what do you do for fun?

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:00.520
 - Yeah, so you move out to the countries,

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.600
 and then you're not gonna farm.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.120
 - I'm not gonna farm.

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:05.240
 No.

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:06.520
 I walk.

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:09.320
 I, what the hell do I do for fun, man?

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.680
 - I know, I have trouble answering this question, too.

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:11.560
 - There's a few games.

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:12.440
 - Yeah, there's a tough one.

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:14.840
 - Oh, I got into juggling randomly last year.

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:15.880
 - Whoa.

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.120
 - Yeah, 'cause I wanted to do something with my hands

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:20.520
 that wasn't like coding or playing video games, you know,

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:22.280
 so I just like got into juggling.

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.680
 And now, every morning,

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:28.360
 sit my boy down for like 20 minutes

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:29.400
 and just aren't juggling.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.240
 It's fantastic.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.080
 - Does he like it?

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:31.920
 - It's great.

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.440
 I've got really good, you know.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:36.040
 (upbeat music)

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:45.040
 - Oh, he's back.

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:45.880
 - I'm back.

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:46.720
 - Yes.

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:49.120
 - My wife, my wife took my keys

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.960
 and then just destroyed my internet somehow

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:55.200
 with like her magnetic field or something,

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:56.600
 something happened in our days.

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.640
 (both laughing)

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:02.760
 - No joke, my wife, like, we've, we're convinced

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:05.360
 she's got something with electricity.

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:09.280
 Like she has fried so many watches in her life.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:11.720
 Like three different watches have died on her.

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.040
 I've never had my watch die.

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:13.880
 - I never even heard of that.

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:14.880
 - Like just stop working.

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:15.880
 - Yeah, no, I'm serious.

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.640
 And then there's other weird stuff that's happened

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.520
 where she like touched something and electronic

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:20.600
 and it stopped working.

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:21.880
 I'm telling you, there's something there.

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:23.240
 We don't understand it all yet.

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:25.120
 - Okay, is there a X-man like that?

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:26.280
 (both laughing)

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.360
 - Maybe.

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:28.200
 (both laughing)

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.200
 - What are you?

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.800
 - What a useless power.

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.480
 The badest stop time, but like not literally just like.

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.160
 - So is that the singular of X-man?

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.000
 X-man?

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:36.840
 I suppose it is, isn't it?

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:37.680
 - X-man.

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.000
 - Yeah, X-man, right?

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.480
 (both laughing)

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.040
 - Hi, I'm an X-man.

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:42.880
 - I'm an X-man.

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:44.600
 - Yeah, you wouldn't say I'm an X-man.

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.280
 - Yeah, that doesn't mean the X-man.

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:48.120
 - I am part of the X-man, I guess.

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:49.120
 - Yeah.

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:50.800
 (both laughing)

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:51.640
 - I'm an X-man.

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:52.480
 - Oh yeah.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.560
 - Like your business card would read X-man, right?

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:55.400
 I mean, for X-man, I guess.

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.120
 - Yeah, yeah, that's your LinkedIn profile, right?

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.960
 That's Wolverine, X-man.

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:01.120
 (both laughing)

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.280
 I was thinking, I've had this for a long time

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:07.040
 where I, you know when you say like I fit in somewhere

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:10.320
 or like the past participle of fit is fit, right?

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:13.240
 I think it should be fat, you know?

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:16.480
 When I join the company, I fucking really well.

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.480
 Like, sats, you know?

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.280
 Do you know what I was like?

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:22.160
 - Oh, oh, it's so good.

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:26.960
 - I think Americans don't use sat as much as you guys do.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:27.800
 - What?

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:28.640
 - Really?

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:31.520
 - No, I say, that's the famous cultural difference.

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.960
 - No, no, no, no, no, here, here, here.

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:36.960
 Of course, we'll say I sat on the bus,

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.280
 but I think you guys also use it in this other way

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:42.680
 where I can't think of an example.

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:45.000
 Like a, there's something where they say like,

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.800
 "I had a sit or something."

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:47.640
 Don't say?

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:48.480
 - How about that?

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:49.600
 - How did I make that up?

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:51.200
 - I had a sit down.

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.200
 Is it, you say that?

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.240
 I'll have a sit down.

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:54.080
 - I have a sit down?

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:54.920
 Yeah, do you say that?

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:55.760
 We don't say that.

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:56.600
 - Yeah, we say that, yeah, yeah.

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:57.480
 Can I have a sit down?

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.040
 - Oh yeah, we wouldn't, we wouldn't say that.

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:00.120
 - Oh, really? Okay, wow.

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.680
 - But there's a time we don't say sat.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:02.520
 - That's what you're saying.

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.560
 - I'm struggling to think of an example, but.

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:06.040
 - I've been struggling this whole conversation

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:08.240
 ever since Matt said past participle.

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.320
 I don't know what that is.

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:12.720
 I'm sure it's a real thing, but I grew up in the Ozarks

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.440
 and I have no idea what that word means.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.920
 - I grew up in the Ozarks and I have no education.

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.440
 - Yeah, basically, yeah.

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:19.280
 - That's my shit.

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:20.120
 - Okay, yeah.

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:20.960
 - But yeah, I like juggling.

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:21.800
 I like juggling a lot, yeah.

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:25.600
 - So, was it like a months long learning curve?

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.120
 Or do you just pick it up pretty quick?

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:28.920
 - Yeah, it's like, if I want to learn to juggle.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:29.760
 - You want to learn?

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.120
 - I said, if I do, I don't, but if I did too much.

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:34.080
 (laughing)

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.080
 - A couple months?

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.440
 - No, no, no, it's not that long.

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.440
 You can probably learn a couple days.

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.960
 - Well, you can juggle.

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:42.400
 - Yeah, the basic, the basic, this one?

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.400
 Yeah, for sure.

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.240
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:45.440
 - I can do two in one hand.

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:46.360
 I can do that for a little bit.

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:47.600
 - Very nice.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:48.440
 Yeah, that's about it.

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:49.720
 - They've got names, you know, there's the cascade.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.800
 There's the reverse cascade.

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:53.640
 There's the little mess.

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:55.040
 - The mess.

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:55.880
 - The tornado.

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:56.880
 - I'm making up.

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.880
 (laughing)

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.440
 - They've got names, though.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:02.280
 (laughing)

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.840
 - I feel like the fact that you can learn it in two days,

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.280
 though, kind of took some of the shine off,

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.160
 a little bit of the mystique of juggling.

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:08.560
 I thought people who could juggle,

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:11.400
 it's like this crazy skill that they've learned over years.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.760
 - But it's not a binary thing.

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:14.920
 Like I can do, like I said, the cascade,

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:16.560
 I think is probably what it is.

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:20.040
 And I probably can't do it as smooth as Mac can,

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.640
 and it's probably a lot of other juggles

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:23.680
 and things you can juggle.

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:26.320
 - You couldn't like go, like, stand on a stage

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.520
 and do cool stuff that people would be entertained by.

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:29.360
 You're not there.

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.960
 - Yeah, I think I would just start insulting people.

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.800
 That's mostly my talent.

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:35.560
 (laughing)

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:37.160
 I don't know if for 30 seconds,

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.200
 and then I would just start insulting the crowd.

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.040
 - Insulting people are not having children.

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.200
 That is the Dax brand.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.320
 (laughing)

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:45.280
 - No, wait, to be clear,

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:47.920
 my bread is not that I'm one of those child-free people,

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:50.400
 'cause I finally put a very, very annoying.

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:54.680
 I wanna make sure that I'm well past the phase in my life

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:57.880
 where I thought that was a cool thing, so.

00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:00.280
 - Glorifying of lack of children.

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:03.040
 Yeah, not part of the Dax brand.

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:05.040
 Just incidentally, not having children.

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:05.880
 - Yes, yes.

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:08.640
 - Okay, I gotta ask what video games do you play?

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:09.640
 - Dax plays video games.

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:10.880
 - I haven't in a while, but.

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:14.160
 - So I'm an enormous football fan, soccer fan.

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:18.120
 So I've played probably, I think about 3,000 hours

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:20.160
 of various football manager games, you know, like.

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:22.840
 - Oh, football manager, I love it, man.

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:25.560
 It just sucks you in.

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:27.440
 - I've actually never heard that term,

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:30.160
 but I can imagine, is it like you manage the team

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:32.200
 and you hire players and you do some of that?

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:33.040
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:35.000
 - 'Cause there's that in American sports games

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.520
 where you can like manage the team, the franchise or whatever

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.920
 and you like manage them over years, but that's so fun.

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.320
 - Football manager, like a dedicated game

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.160
 where it's just that and there's no like.

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:45.480
 - Oh, see that's the problem with the other games.

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.880
 Like if you play Madden, like I used to in college.

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.800
 - You have to actually play the football game.

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.480
 - Yeah, or you like sim the games,

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.600
 but then you lose something.

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.680
 It's kind of like less of a game.

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.640
 It's you lose something if you don't play the game.

00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:59.600
 It's not quite as like a first party.

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.400
 Like this is the point of the thing.

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:02.240
 So that's awesome.

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.440
 There's a game that the whole point is just to be the manager.

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:05.280
 - It's great.

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:07.480
 - Are there even like, there aren't games?

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:08.480
 You don't have to play them.

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.880
 You just, it's assumed.

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.880
 They're gonna all be simulated as how it works.

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.760
 Or can you actually play the game?

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.760
 Like you can actually play the football game now.

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:17.600
 - No, you can't.

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:18.440
 - No, you just.

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:19.280
 - Just the man. - You're just on the side.

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:20.120
 - Yeah. - You're watching.

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:20.960
 - That's the best.

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:22.480
 - You're making subs, you're shouting onto the field.

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:23.960
 - Yep. - You're.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.560
 - Oh wait, you're actually on the side of the,

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:27.840
 like on the side line. - Like your first person view

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:29.040
 or something, you're like.

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:29.880
 - Okay, okay.

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.480
 You're looking definitely buff.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:32.600
 - You got it. - Yeah.

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:33.440
 - It's great. - Yeah, no.

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.600
 - I've asked a lot of questions.

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:35.920
 - I'm gonna start. - I'm gonna be our head, sir.

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.760
 And the experience is just being on the side

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:38.600
 of a soccer match.

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:39.800
 It's just like.

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:41.240
 - Also, I'm not joking that I've played

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:43.640
 a lot of Eurotruck simulator too.

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:45.200
 - Oh, you're one of those people I see.

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:47.120
 Okay, I'm gonna feel, you like the simulations.

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:49.560
 You like living another life.

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:50.560
 - I like, I like lots of stuff.

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:51.920
 But like, weirdly, yeah.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:54.120
 I got, I mean, I bought like a steering wheel for that.

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.480
 You know what I mean? - Yeah, I got like two.

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:56.320
 - Have you, yeah.

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.400
 It's really, weirdly addictive.

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:00.000
 - What is a Eurotruck?

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.880
 - You said a Eurotruck simulator?

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:02.720
 - It's a American truck.

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:04.080
 - It's a truck simulator, and then Eurotruck,

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.080
 it's not Eurotruck simulator.

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:09.640
 (both laughing)

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:13.120
 - So it's a European truck, like like a 18-wheeler.

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:16.400
 Like you drive across the country and deliver goods,

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.240
 but it's a simulator to do that.

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:19.080
 - Really?

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:20.200
 - And it's really common.

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:21.040
 - What part are you simulating?

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:23.680
 Are you simulating the driver or the logistics people

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:25.280
 that are figuring out where to get stuff?

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:28.280
 - You have the football match, you want to see the truck go by.

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:29.680
 (both laughing)

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:31.840
 - It's the first soccer ball.

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:34.760
 (both laughing)

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:36.600
 - Oh, yeah.

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:38.360
 - No, you're driving.

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:39.200
 Yeah, you're driving.

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.040
 You know, it's got like--

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:40.880
 - You're driving.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:42.520
 - Realistic rain simulation, you know?

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:43.360
 - Yeah.

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:44.200
 - Wait a minute.

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:45.040
 You're telling me, I'm sorry.

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.800
 - Yeah, people literally do this.

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:48.720
 - There are simulations for being a truck driver?

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:49.640
 - Yeah, yep.

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:50.480
 - It's like five--

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:51.320
 - That's a thing.

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:54.840
 - It's like five quid, and it is so relaxing.

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:57.640
 It is like the pieces of relaxation.

00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:59.640
 - And it's real, like, so I have so many questions.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.240
 - Is it like a flight simulator in the sense

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:03.200
 that it's real environments, like real highways?

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.040
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:04.880
 - Oh, it really is.

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:05.880
 - Realish, you know.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:07.040
 Like, 'cause you don't want to be driving the truck

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:08.280
 for like eight hours at a time, you know?

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:10.040
 So it's like, oh, you made it to--

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:10.880
 - Yeah.

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.480
 - I don't know, speeds it up on whatever.

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:14.560
 Yeah, and there's, you know, you get all this DLC

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:17.640
 where it expands the map of Europe and stuff and--

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:19.080
 - Okay, this actually sounds great.

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:20.600
 - I just, when you think about it being like

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:23.440
 a truck driver simulator, it sounds less appealing,

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.760
 but then the more you describe it,

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:25.760
 I could see it being fun.

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:28.080
 - It would be a crazy plot twist

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:31.040
 if eventually they just connected you to real trucks,

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:32.280
 then you're just running real routes,

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:35.920
 and they just got rid of having to have them pay drivers

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.200
 so people wouldn't do it for free,

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.880
 as long as they can do it from their house.

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:42.640
 - To be honest-- - Yeah, that is cool.

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:45.040
 I got super into, so the reason I have a steering wheel

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:48.640
 is I got really into racing, like to the point

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:51.400
 where I had the VR headset, the steering wheel,

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:53.360
 the force feedback, like all of that stuff,

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:57.720
 and me and my friends would just spend hours every single day

00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:00.600
 just racing the same track over and over like lap,

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:02.920
 after lap, after lap, and we'd be like,

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.320
 "Oh man, got down like one-tenth of a second,"

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:07.360
 and that was like a big accomplishment for it.

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:11.840
 And it's, I feel like physical grooves

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:13.360
 in my brain around that track.

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:15.160
 Like if I like go and play it again,

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:16.960
 I can like feel the turns,

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:18.880
 I can feel exactly what everything is.

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:20.680
 You did it so much. - That's awesome.

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:22.280
 - That's super into it, yeah.

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:24.240
 - I love that kind of, that's such a thing,

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:27.600
 the unique to video games is it kind of, it retrains your brain

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:28.760
 in a certain way, you know what I mean?

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:31.280
 Like you just respond to stimuli differently

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:36.280
 when you really log in and like, ah, that's great.

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:37.680
 I admire that.

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:38.520
 - Totally escapes, yeah.

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:42.360
 And even when I'm driving, so my, the thing I always say

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:44.840
 is everyone says that, oh, where I'm from

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:47.520
 as a craziest driver is, but like objectively it is Miami,

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:49.520
 like anyone that comes here is always like,

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:51.520
 oh, okay, nevermind, it's fine back home.

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:53.960
 Like people are insane. - Yeah.

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:55.600
 - So I'm always having to do like crazy maneuvers

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:58.640
 to dodge people and I can feel like the training

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:00.160
 from the simulator, like kind of kick in.

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:01.800
 Like I'm like hitting the brake and turning the wheel

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:03.560
 in a certain way and like-- - Wow.

00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:04.920
 - It's funny though, 'cause I'm like--

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:06.400
 - Drifting. (laughing)

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:07.240
 - Crazy.

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:08.680
 (laughing)

00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:10.960
 - Well, race cars are funny 'cause they don't have

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:13.200
 all this automatic stuff that normal cars do.

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:15.160
 So it's very easy to like spin out.

00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:18.680
 Don't like treating my car as though it's that sensitive,

00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:21.760
 it's not like it doesn't need me to be that intentional

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.360
 about things, but yeah.

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.440
 - Are you into Formula One Dax?

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:26.680
 - Yeah, super, I haven't been to it as into it

00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:28.840
 in the last couple of years, but there was a period of time

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:30.760
 where I was like obsessively following it.

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:31.600
 Yeah.

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:33.240
 And they opened up a Miami track in the last two years.

00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:35.560
 I haven't gone yet, but I do plan to do that.

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:37.480
 - Yeah, I got into it in a few years ago

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:39.080
 when Verstappen was racing Hamilton

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:40.640
 and it was really, really exciting.

00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:42.560
 And then Verstappen's just won every time

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.360
 and I really hate that little rat boy.

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:45.880
 I just wanted to lose all the time.

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:48.720
 (laughing)

00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:49.800
 - My thing, okay.

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:52.680
 So here's my thing with Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes.

00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:55.480
 - Obviously for years, he was just crushing everyone.

00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:57.880
 But do you remember that race when they put,

00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:01.920
 he's a younger kid, he was on another team

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:04.080
 and they put him in the Mercedes car?

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.720
 One of the races.

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:07.480
 Yes, was it, was it Russell?

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:08.600
 - Yeah.

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.200
 And he like was doing insane.

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:12.600
 He did like so much better than he ever did before.

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:15.200
 And I was like, okay, so now I know how much of this

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.320
 is Lewis Hamilton and how much of it is,

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:20.040
 is like the Mercedes team is obviously amazing.

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:22.000
 Obviously it's both and there's like a crazy synergy

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.560
 and you know that, if you like follow the sport.

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:26.360
 But yeah, it was weird to see this guy

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:27.960
 that was pretty much always in the last place,

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:30.640
 every single race, just so like rocketed at first.

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:32.880
 And I think in that race, it was something crazy.

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.640
 Like his car like hit a nail or something

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:35.880
 and he got a flat tire.

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:39.640
 And so that's why he ended up not going like this.

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:41.880
 - And then Sergio Perez came from like starting 20th

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.320
 to finishing first.

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:45.520
 Like it would be one of the craziest races for the time.

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:48.160
 Yeah, but it's never that exciting, like.

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.000
 - Exactly.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:49.840
 That's what I was gonna say.

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:52.760
 - So the thing with F1 is why I stopped watching it is,

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:55.760
 it's a two hour or so race on like the actual race day.

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:59.400
 And you're sitting there watching, hoping you catch,

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:00.720
 hoping that this race is the one

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.640
 where something really insane happens.

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:05.360
 But most races are very technical and consistent.

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:09.680
 It's like the people that started in first ended up in first.

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.840
 Cause like it's a formula and everyone's like drilled it.

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:15.200
 And like this guy always gets 1/10 of a second faster

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.040
 on every lap.

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:18.360
 So he ends up first, like it's always works out that way.

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:22.360
 But occasionally you'll get like these five minute bursts

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:24.760
 of like the most exciting thing you've ever seen in your life.

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:27.000
 So you're just chasing that all the time.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:27.840
 - Yeah.

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:29.080
 It's built for highlights basically.

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:32.080
 And there's often races where there are just no highlights.

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:34.560
 It's absolutely insane.

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:38.120
 How can you design this for this boring,

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:43.120
 but sometimes it's mildly exciting.

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:47.520
 - Well, it's about the lifestyle also, right?

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:51.520
 It's like the classic one was who was like,

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:53.200
 who was the guy that always was with Hamilton,

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:54.960
 that was his teammate?

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:55.800
 - Bottas.

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:56.640
 - Bottas.

00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:59.960
 I think it was him where I think it was in Monaco.

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:02.560
 He crashed 'cause he was out of the race

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:06.200
 and he gets out of his car, walks off the track,

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:09.720
 keeps walking straight onto a yacht and just sits there.

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:11.040
 (laughing)

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.560
 That's the rest of the race.

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.240
 Yeah, he was like, he was like, I'm done with the race.

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:17.680
 He just walked right off onto the yacht, those parked right there.

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:22.160
 So it's like a, you know, it's like rich world sport.

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.000
 - Yep.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:23.840
 - You gotta get to it.

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:24.760
 - It's rich NASCAR.

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:25.600
 - Yeah.

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:26.440
 - This is what I'm gathering.

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:28.200
 - Yeah, this is what a NASCAR is like hillbillies

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:30.840
 and Midwestern United States.

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:33.600
 Formula One sounds like very rich people in Europe.

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:34.440
 - Yeah.

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:35.280
 - Is that accurate?

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:37.920
 - Someone joked about like, yeah, we're all just watching

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:40.520
 a bunch of billionaires like race around the track.

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:41.880
 (laughing)

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:44.200
 - Yeah, we're on a track on all of that for so hours.

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.240
 - Billionaires in traffic, basically.

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:46.240
 Just going around and around.

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:47.080
 - Exactly.

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:47.920
 (laughing)

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:50.200
 - I can't hear that, he's depressing.

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:52.440
 - I actually really, I've wanted to get into F1,

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.200
 same with European football.

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:56.160
 Like, these are things, as an American,

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:57.760
 there's things I wish I had.

00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.200
 I wish I'd used the metric system.

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:01.560
 I wish I was into football like the rest of the world.

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:02.680
 And I've wanted to get into F1,

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:04.760
 but you guys are not making a great dish.

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:06.040
 It's not sounding like a thing.

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:06.880
 Okay.

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:08.600
 - The best thing about this is just a Netflix series,

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.000
 'cause that like dramatizes everything.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000
 - So that's what I heard.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.920
 I heard it's so good and you'll get into F1.

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:14.680
 - That's what that means to that, as well.

00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:15.520
 - Yeah.

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:16.760
 - Okay, so I can just watch the Netflix part

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:18.160
 and then not get into the sport

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:20.000
 and I get the best of all of it.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:20.840
 - Okay.

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:24.920
 - What's crazy is that that Netflix series,

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:27.720
 so F1 as a sport has grown like insane

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:29.480
 ever since that series.

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:32.360
 Like just that one decision to let a film crew in

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:34.480
 and do this, I think it like,

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:38.120
 like these teams are valued at a crazy amount now.

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:40.000
 People that invest in the teams at the right time

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.200
 having a crazy return that they're looking at.

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:46.600
 But yeah, just that one documentary was super effective.

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:47.880
 So you should go watch it, yeah.

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:49.480
 - Another thing that I'm kind of into

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:51.440
 or I'm sort of going and out is chess.

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:52.600
 I really like chess.

00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:53.440
 - Okay.

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:55.320
 - I used to play a little bit, like actually in person

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:58.000
 locally as well, but I kind of suck.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.280
 And the Queen's Gambit did exactly--

00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:03.240
 - Oh, I've watched the Queen's Gambit.

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.480
 - Blued it, chess.

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:07.000
 Like it sort of came at the same time as lockdown

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.560
 and chess is free to get into and you can just play

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:12.080
 and it has like this literally,

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:12.920
 that's what they talk about.

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:14.680
 It's like an era before the Queen's Gambit

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:16.600
 and an era after the Queen's Gambit.

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:17.440
 - Interesting.

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:18.280
 - It's just fantastic.

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:20.880
 - Like chess clubs and local like chess places

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.600
 and blew up and attended that for now.

00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:23.520
 - Yeah, I've seen that.

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:25.200
 - One of the biggest things on Twitch.

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:28.000
 Like they have chess tournaments

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.720
 like first streamers on Twitch as well

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:32.840
 like PogChamps or something.

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:34.400
 It's huge.

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:35.240
 Like chess--

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:36.080
 - Interesting.

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:37.280
 - Biggest chess YouTuber Gotham chess

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:38.840
 gets millions of views per video.

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:40.720
 Like crazy, crazy.

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:42.520
 - It's actually just like tech Twitter

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:44.720
 'cause I will peek into there once a while

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:48.200
 and it'll be like guy reacts to Gotham chess

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:49.440
 and he's like, there's some drama

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:51.080
 and they're like, I'll piss at each other and--

00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:51.920
 - Oh, yeah.

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:52.760
 - Yeah.

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:55.440
 - There was a guy who was accused of cheating.

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:56.560
 - Yes, I remember that whole thing.

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:57.400
 That was crazy.

00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.760
 - I, via anal beads.

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:00.600
 - Yes.

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:01.440
 (laughing)

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:02.840
 - I'm sorry, what now?

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:03.680
 - Yes.

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:05.280
 - I'm gonna need you to elaborate a little bit.

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:06.840
 - So when you go into a chance tournament,

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:08.800
 they obviously, you can't have a phone

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.320
 'cause then you can just look up the moves.

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:12.520
 You can't be communicated with in any ways

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:13.840
 or they search you.

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:18.120
 And this guy was supposedly getting hints

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:21.880
 via vibrating anal beads that he had.

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:22.800
 - Wow.

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:23.720
 - Allegedly.

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:25.400
 - That is magic level.

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:26.240
 - Yeah.

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:27.080
 - I know.

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:29.040
 - Wait, wasn't that like Magnus Carlson accused him

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.080
 of that, wasn't it?

00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:31.160
 - I think he said something.

00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:35.560
 So Magna Carlson, biggest one of the best chess players

00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:38.120
 of all time, he said something like,

00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:40.800
 you know, he doesn't seem like he's playing like a human,

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:44.240
 you know, he seems like a human with, you know,

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:45.480
 some stuff going on.

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:47.040
 - Anal beads, of course.

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:47.880
 (laughing)

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:49.240
 - I'm convinced, I don't know about the anal beads thing,

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:51.840
 but I'm convinced that I could pull off cheating

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:53.280
 in one of those tournaments.

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:56.040
 I feel like it's, if you are like committed to cheating,

00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:59.560
 if it doesn't seem that hard to sneak something in,

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:00.400
 is it that hard?

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:02.400
 They didn't make you play naked, like what?

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:03.960
 - It's actually, it's really interesting

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:06.600
 because they actually couldn't just feel

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:08.260
 when you're cheating.

00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:09.680
 - Yeah, this is the, yeah.

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:11.520
 Well, I mean, it would be suspicious if I just showed up

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:12.880
 and he started like racking people,

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:16.040
 but never heard of you and you're beating everyone, yeah.

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:17.640
 - Beating's, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:19.900
 (laughing)

00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:23.400
 - That's the American accent confusing us again.

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:25.240
 Not beating, beating.

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:26.080
 (laughing)

00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:27.080
 - Not beating, yeah.

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:29.120
 (laughing)

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:30.760
 - Beating.

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:33.320
 - We have said anal beads on this episode,

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:34.360
 at least six times.

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:35.960
 That's six times more than any other episode.

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:36.800
 - That's great.

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.200
 It's coming up in the most innocent way possible

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:39.520
 in reference to--

00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:41.000
 - Absolutely. - Put up chess.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:41.840
 - Yeah.

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:43.360
 (laughing)

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:46.200
 - Didn't he also get banned from chess.com

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:48.680
 for other cheating he'd done in the past?

00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:52.200
 - And no idea, yeah, I sort of,

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:54.920
 I came in at anal beads and left anal beads, so.

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:55.920
 (laughing)

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:57.560
 That was my interest.

00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:58.400
 Pete.

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:00.640
 (laughing)

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:03.840
 (laughing)

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:05.160
 - Now I wanna get into chess.

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:07.360
 Everything you've described, I just wanna get into it.

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:08.200
 - I don't know if you're smart enough.

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:10.560
 - But you have a very, you're a good communicator man.

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:11.400
 - Thank you.

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:12.240
 - You're selling me.

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:13.080
 Selling me on chess.

00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:14.200
 - About chess, it's great fun.

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:17.200
 I mean, it's very dangerous for you because

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:18.920
 I got into it when I was a singing teacher

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:21.120
 and I just like, you know,

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:23.080
 you play like five minute games or something.

00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:24.360
 You know, five minutes for you,

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:25.640
 five minutes for your opponent.

00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:27.520
 I got into like three minute games as well.

00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:29.360
 And I just, you know, stopped answering emails basically.

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:31.280
 I just stopped functioning as a human being.

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:32.120
 (laughing)

00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:34.400
 And my business went like that.

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:37.560
 I got, I didn't even improve that much as well as the project.

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:39.200
 (laughing)

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:43.360
 I sacrificed, ironically, sacrificed so much time to it.

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:46.280
 And I just sort of got maybe a five percent better.

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:47.920
 It was horrendous.

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:51.440
 - That's exactly my experience with video games.

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:53.400
 Like, 'cause Steam, when you like go to click

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:54.240
 to play an era of games,

00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:56.160
 it shows you right there how many hours you've put into it.

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:57.000
 - Oh yeah.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.640
 - So certain games were hundreds and hundreds and hundreds

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:02.680
 of hours and I'm like not really that good.

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:03.520
 - Yeah.

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:05.400
 - I'm like 10 percent better than where it was when I started.

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:06.240
 - Yeah.

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:07.080
 - The rocket league.

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:07.920
 - Absolutely.

00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:08.760
 - Yeah.

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:09.600
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:11.000
 Everyone that plays video games is better than me.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.760
 That's like my experience of playing any multiplayer.

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:14.680
 I'm like, oh, I'm just literally the worst person

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:16.000
 in the world 'cause they can't match me

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.480
 with a single person that I am better than.

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:21.400
 - Yeah, my experience with games was always that

00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:22.600
 I'm just so slow.

00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:24.800
 And I thought it was just that I was like

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:26.320
 of the wrong generation or something.

00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:28.600
 Like is it the younger generation is just twittier

00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:32.160
 and faster and like, but I guess it's card games too.

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:34.320
 Any like speed, any card game where you have like

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:36.120
 slapperly fast, I'm so slow.

00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:37.320
 I have like terrible reactions.

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:39.080
 - We're spending like so much time on my hobbies,

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:40.640
 but like that is actually the main thing

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:41.880
 that I'm into is board games.

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:42.720
 - Oh really?

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:44.240
 I've been trying, I wanted to start,

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:45.400
 I wanted to like enter that.

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:46.240
 - Okay, yeah.

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:47.080
 I'm your guy.

00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:48.120
 I can help.

00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:50.120
 - Do you like collect them as well?

00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:50.960
 I knew someone collected them.

00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:52.280
 - I've got a shelf of board games.

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:53.120
 Yeah.

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:56.200
 And actually there's very spill over shelves in here as well.

00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:57.240
 I like.

00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:58.760
 - What's your favorite board game?

00:43:58.760 --> 00:43:59.680
 Or your top three?

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:01.080
 - Right now, I guess.

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:03.120
 I know it's always changed for the board game people.

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:05.080
 - It is, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:06.360
 I haven't gotten to play that much

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:09.760
 in like the last five months or so for six reasons.

00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:10.600
 Yeah.

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:11.440
 - That life goes.

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:14.400
 - Cosmic encounter, I think has to be my favorite board game.

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:15.560
 - I've never heard of it.

00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:17.440
 - What is the pitch, the description?

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:19.400
 - It is relatively simple.

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:21.000
 It's like poker in space.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.160
 So you're bluffing, you're trying to take over

00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:25.280
 other people's planets.

00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:26.920
 It's pretty simple, you're playing cards

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:28.560
 and doing various things.

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:31.240
 But there are a hundred different aliens

00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:34.840
 that ship in the box and everyone is a different alien race.

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:38.920
 And they all have powers that just completely break the game.

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:40.840
 So every single game is different.

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:41.760
 - Oh, nice, I love that.

00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:43.000
 - Every game's different.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.840
 - There's a power where like one player

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:47.560
 maybe their ships just can't be killed.

00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:48.840
 They are indestructible.

00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:51.800
 And it's like, how the hell are we gonna get around that?

00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:52.640
 You know what I mean?

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:54.160
 And so you gotta work together, you gotta negotiate,

00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:56.400
 you gotta work out, okay, we'll just destroy them first

00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:57.880
 and then go to this person.

00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:00.480
 Then it turns out that this person has some hidden secret power

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:02.960
 where it takes 10 turns

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:04.240
 and they just win the game automatically.

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:05.080
 You know what I mean?

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:07.880
 It's just explosions of various stuff

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:09.840
 and it's so much fun.

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:12.000
 So every single game is different.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:12.960
 - What was it called again?

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.320
 - Cosmic encounter.

00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:15.480
 - Cosmic encounter.

00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:18.400
 So that sounds incredible.

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.840
 It sounds like the best board game I've ever heard of.

00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:23.240
 If you ever like actually go to Target in America

00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:25.120
 and like look at the board games,

00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:26.640
 there's never any good board games.

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:28.400
 It's like all the classics are at the top

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:30.240
 and then all the new stuff is garbage.

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:32.480
 I've never seen anything remotely interesting like that.

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:33.320
 - Yeah, I know.

00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:34.160
 This is like a different world.

00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:35.920
 So I have a friend here that is super into board games.

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:37.480
 He gave me this game called Castles.

00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:39.400
 I don't know if you've heard of that one.

00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:40.400
 - Just Castles?

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:41.400
 - I think it's just called Castles.

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:42.720
 Yeah, we've still yet to--

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:44.520
 - Castles are Mad King Ludwig or something.

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:47.000
 No, no, I mean that was actually a board game.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.280
 That's not a punishment even.

00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:49.120
 - Oh really?

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:53.040
 - Uh, of Mad King Ludwig.

00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:54.640
 Okay, is it this one?

00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:55.480
 Yes, it's this one.

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:56.320
 - Oh yeah, yeah.

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:57.920
 - What's the same one that Matt just said?

00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:58.760
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:45:58.760 --> 00:45:59.600
 The box.

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:01.400
 - I've never played it, but it's supposed to be really good.

00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:02.680
 - Wait, actually it's right behind me.

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:03.520
 - Oh, sick.

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:05.040
 - Oh, we're gonna get a little visual.

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:05.880
 - Yeah, no, I can't.

00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:08.240
 It's under a bunch of other board games, but yeah, okay.

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:09.600
 It is, it is this one.

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:10.760
 Me and my wife still haven't played it,

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:13.400
 but he recommended it because it's good

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:14.600
 if you're like new to this stuff

00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:16.880
 and it's fun even with just two people.

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:18.880
 And I think that was my count.

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:20.240
 Like a lot of traditional board games,

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:22.080
 like they all suck with two people.

00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:24.480
 Like so boring, but this world,

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:26.720
 like then there's a lot of options for things like that.

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:29.080
 - Yeah, I don't have people to come play with me.

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:31.320
 So it would have to be good for two or two people.

00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:32.160
 - How many kids?

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:33.800
 - Like if my oldest, I've got a,

00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:36.360
 he's eight is my oldest and then four.

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:37.760
 So eight, yeah, could an eight year old

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:38.920
 play cosmic encounter?

00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:40.080
 'Cause this sounds so fun.

00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:43.240
 - So I think yes, I think yes, actually.

00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:45.840
 - Okay, probably not a four year old.

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:47.760
 He'd probably have to resort to cheating.

00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:48.600
 - Yeah.

00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:49.760
 - Not in the way that we've talked about.

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:53.040
 - That was too hot, not gonna make that joke.

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:54.680
 Not about my four year old, nope.

00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:56.120
 (laughing)

00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:58.120
 - It's just gonna move right past that one.

00:46:58.120 --> 00:46:59.640
 - So this episode has got a lovely,

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:01.800
 kind of cyclical nature.

00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:03.120
 (laughing)

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:04.840
 So it was just wiggling down.

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:07.560
 So it was the same two words again and again.

00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:09.820
 (laughing)

00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:15.640
 - Okay, so where do you get the good board games?

00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:16.560
 Where do you find these?

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:17.400
 'Cause they're not at Target.

00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:19.340
 - Yeah, I mean, there's a board game cafe

00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:20.960
 in Oxford that I go to

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:25.960
 that my friend works out, actually works it different.

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:28.360
 But yeah, they've just got hundreds of these things.

00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:29.520
 They're great.

00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:32.320
 - Okay, yeah, I'm just gonna buy 'em online.

00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:33.160
 (laughing)

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:34.500
 It's like, they don't have some of them.

00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:35.340
 - They're looking about right now.

00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:37.520
 'Cause once they have my house in the grocery store

00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:38.680
 and that's basically it.

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:40.320
 (laughing)

00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:41.160
 - My house.

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:45.280
 - This is not already in the house, it's not there.

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:46.880
 - Boardgamegeek.com.

00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:47.720
 Do you guys visit this?

00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:48.920
 Is this your home page?

00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:49.760
 (laughing)

00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:51.140
 - Very well respected.

00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:53.560
 A well respected right here, yeah.

00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:54.640
 - It was number one on Google

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:56.440
 when I searched for cosmic encounters,

00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:57.960
 so I get the sense.

00:47:57.960 --> 00:47:59.880
 - Yeah, yeah, I've seen my friend's collection

00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:01.160
 and he's got so many.

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:03.480
 And some of them take an hour to set up

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:07.120
 and so complex and once it's set up,

00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:10.600
 you have to play it over the course of weeks even

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:12.420
 and you can't touch it or mess it up.

00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:14.080
 - Jeez.

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:14.900
 - It's cool.

00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:17.600
 - How many, do you have friends that just come over, Matt?

00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:19.600
 How do you play board games typically?

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:20.600
 Do you have a board game night?

00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:22.280
 - Yeah, I have a couple of game nights that I go to.

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:25.360
 I was looking to set up like a JavaScript meetup

00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:28.600
 with this guy called Pete who lives locally

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:31.080
 and we just sort of gave that up

00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:32.820
 and started playing board games instead.

00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:34.920
 (laughing)

00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:36.240
 - JavaScript is boring.

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:37.560
 - JavaScript is boring.

00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:38.400
 (laughing)

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:39.680
 Yeah, just do that instead.

00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:41.080
 And it's way more fun.

00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:44.800
 And yeah, yeah, so I've got some board game dads

00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:47.360
 that hang out with as well, you know, like, it's great.

00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:48.520
 - It's a great way to meet people, honestly.

00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:49.680
 - That's awesome.

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:51.200
 - That is cool.

00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:53.360
 All right, so I'm gonna switch topics a little bit

00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:57.080
 just 'cause, you know, let's talk about JavaScript,

00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:57.920
 I guess.

00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:00.160
 (laughing)

00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:02.960
 - So what are you working on these days?

00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:05.640
 So I know you had your big course,

00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:08.560
 which seems very successful.

00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:10.480
 Are you working on like more stuff related to that?

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:12.720
 Like what is, what's occupying your time?

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:14.360
 - Yeah, so since August last year,

00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:17.760
 I've been working on two things that are linked.

00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:20.680
 I've been writing a book.

00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:23.560
 And that book is now with the publishers.

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:26.240
 So it's been published through No Starch

00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:29.000
 and it's kind of being done in the No Starch style.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:30.640
 It's sort of part of their range.

00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:33.040
 And it's gonna link in with a new course

00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:34.440
 that I'm building as well,

00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:36.240
 which is basically like,

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:38.480
 if you think of total time scripts, my course,

00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:40.440
 it's kind of not really total.

00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:43.600
 And I mean, it's kind of like intermediate

00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:45.360
 and up, up, up, up.

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:48.480
 I mean, I haven't really tackled the beginner-y stuff

00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:51.640
 all the way up to intermediate and that sort of area.

00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:53.040
 - Yeah, so you've made stuff for DAX,

00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:54.040
 you haven't made anything for me.

00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:54.880
 - Yes, exactly.

00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:56.400
 I need the beginning.

00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:57.240
 - The beginning.

00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:59.400
 - Yeah, early, early beginning.

00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:00.240
 - Yeah.

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:02.680
 - I haven't done that because it's really hard.

00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:04.280
 It's really hard to teach that stuff in a way

00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:05.320
 that I like to teach it,

00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:08.800
 which is in an exciting way, you know?

00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:12.400
 I like to actually find the nuggets of good information

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:14.440
 and pull them out and hone in on those

00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:17.240
 and kind of fix it in people's brains in a really good way.

00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:19.040
 Like, this is techniques that I learned

00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:20.720
 from singing teaching, you know what I mean?

00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:23.280
 If you just tell someone do it, then they do it.

00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:25.600
 But if you tell someone in a metaphorical way

00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:28.600
 where it makes sense and the information's organized correctly

00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:31.320
 and they're having challenges that they go along the way.

00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:35.480
 So it has taken, I think there's like 400 videos on it,

00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:38.640
 like 200 exercises, like it's nuts.

00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:39.480
 - Oh my god.

00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:40.400
 - Huge thing.

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:41.480
 - Wow.

00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:42.640
 - That I've been planning and recording.

00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:45.760
 I'm also doing workshops on so I've been doing live workshops

00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:48.880
 at a couple of companies to kind of test the material out

00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:49.720
 and stuff.

00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:52.080
 It has been a huge amount of work.

00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:53.240
 And then baby came along as well.

00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:56.400
 So it's been sort of slowly growing since January.

00:50:56.400 --> 00:51:00.960
 And so that, I think is gonna come out in June.

00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:02.360
 Like, it's gonna come out pretty soon.

00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:03.200
 - Wow.

00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:05.000
 - And it's going to be, despite all this work,

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.960
 it's going to be, I think about a third of the price

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:09.440
 of total time scripts.

00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:12.560
 So it's gonna be priced at kind of beginning to medium level.

00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:13.400
 - Yeah.

00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:14.240
 So they're gonna buy for themselves.

00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:15.080
 Yeah.

00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:15.920
 That makes sense.

00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:18.840
 - And I'm trying to make it so that it's like,

00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:21.520
 'cause I think we total tax script as it is currently,

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:24.000
 a team will look at that and they'll go,

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.280
 we'll look a bit advanced.

00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:26.120
 You know what I mean?

00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:28.800
 Like, are my engineers really gonna benefit from this?

00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:30.040
 You know, it's obviously expensive,

00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:33.320
 obviously worth the money, but like it's advanced.

00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:35.520
 I kind of wanna just make a no brainer course.

00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:38.760
 Like that a company can buy, you know, like 50 off

00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:40.280
 or something and just go bam,

00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:42.320
 train all your engineers and let's just have it.

00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:43.160
 And that's it.

00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:45.680
 So that's what I've been working on for 10 months.

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:46.520
 Yeah.

00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:47.520
 Wow.

00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:48.360
 Crazy.

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:49.600
 - The question I have is,

00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:54.280
 so I think there's this interesting dynamic that exists now,

00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:59.280
 which is you presume that a beginner is entering,

00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:02.640
 like they know programming,

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:06.920
 but like dynamic languages and learning a typed language

00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:10.040
 is like a next step thing that you do

00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:11.680
 and that people perceive it in that order.

00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:12.520
 And I think that makes sense.

00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:13.720
 I think that is true a lot of people,

00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:15.320
 they do follow that path.

00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:17.920
 But to the point where people describe it as like,

00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:20.600
 oh, it's like too challenging to learn both

00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:23.240
 at the same time if you're new to programming.

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:26.120
 But then I think back to my own journey

00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:29.680
 and like I started with C#, which is a type language

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:32.520
 and types with effectively this exact like C#.

00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:35.800
 And yeah, it's not like I understood all the deep type stuff

00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:39.920
 'til later, but it also didn't get that much in my way.

00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:41.640
 Like I still get to learn programming.

00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:44.560
 It wasn't in like, I don't remember being that much

00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:47.000
 about hassle to learn and learn about types.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:51.080
 So is your course targeting like someone new to programming,

00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:52.760
 someone that knows programming,

00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:55.840
 but doesn't like, how do you think about all that?

00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:58.880
 - If you look at like TypeScript's documentation,

00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:00.920
 it's targeted at people who already know JavaScript,

00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:02.200
 basically, you know what I mean?

00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:03.600
 It's not really for new programmers.

00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:06.600
 And I don't think TypeScript is,

00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:10.080
 because TypeScript is JavaScript, you know what I mean?

00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:13.880
 Every design decision that has been made by TypeScript

00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:16.320
 is made because it compiles to JavaScript.

00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:18.560
 That's the reason, that's the reason it exists.

00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:21.680
 And so in my course, I just assume people know JavaScript

00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:22.640
 to a decent level.

00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:25.600
 And that I think is like a decent assumption.

00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:27.960
 It's not always paid off that well in the live workshops

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:30.560
 'cause some people like who come to the live workshops

00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:31.840
 have only done Python, you know what I mean?

00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:33.320
 I've had a couple of people like that.

00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:36.240
 And it's structured in such a way where, you know,

00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:39.040
 like they get a sense of what the JavaScript does,

00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:41.600
 but actually, it's mostly just teaching the types.

00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:43.680
 And that I think is where the industry is right now.

00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:46.160
 It's like, a lot of people know JavaScript

00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:48.760
 and a lot of people that know it a bit

00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:50.520
 and just need to be moved over to TypeScript,

00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:53.200
 join the TypeScript revolution, you know.

00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:54.320
 Yeah, so that's where it is.

00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:57.080
 - Yeah, so like the specific cases I think about

00:53:57.080 --> 00:53:59.880
 is because my wife has been learning programming.

00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:01.360
 She's not new to building software.

00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:03.840
 She's done everything besides the actual programming part.

00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:05.920
 So if she's coming with some context,

00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:07.680
 but there were specific things.

00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:09.120
 So we tried doing that route where like,

00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:10.240
 I learned JavaScript first,

00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:13.520
 like let's ignore the types stuff for now.

00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:15.000
 But there were certain concepts

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.840
 that were actually made easier with types.

00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:19.240
 So I was trying to explain to her

00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:21.480
 what function arguments were.

00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:24.600
 Like, now here's a function, some A, B.

00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:29.760
 It was way easier for me to use the TypeScript version

00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:32.280
 of that where it said A colon number.

00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:34.120
 'Cause then I clicked for her bar.

00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:35.760
 She was like, oh, this is an argument

00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:37.120
 that always has to be a number.

00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:38.200
 Of course, that's some function

00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:39.880
 you go with the passing numbers.

00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:42.560
 So that one, that specific case, I was like,

00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:43.960
 oh yeah, it's maybe like even better

00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:48.160
 to have a statically typed language, even for a beginner.

00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:50.720
 And then two, obviously all the,

00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:53.480
 when she went off to do something on her own,

00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:56.560
 doing TypeScript gave her way more hints in the editor.

00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:59.920
 And I found that to be like, we didn't have

00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:01.400
 the LSP setup initially.

00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:02.240
 And then when I turned it on,

00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:03.640
 she was like, so I was getting all this feedback

00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:05.880
 and that like helped her massively also.

00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:07.440
 - Yeah, that's fascinating to me that.

00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:09.000
 'Cause that is something I've been turning over

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.000
 in my head for a while, really.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.200
 Like, since I've started doing this course,

00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:15.840
 it's part of me is thinking,

00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:18.560
 what if this was targeted at new programmers?

00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:19.800
 What would that look like?

00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:23.160
 And probably TypeScript will get to a point at some point

00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:26.200
 where it just doesn't make sense to learn JavaScript first

00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:28.400
 because you're not going to get actual JavaScript jobs.

00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:31.800
 They're mostly 95% can be TypeScript jobs, you know?

00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:32.640
 - Yeah.

00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:34.200
 - So you're probably right.

00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:36.080
 Like there's this kind of,

00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:38.120
 the idea to just feel so much more powerful.

00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:39.120
 You're getting all these hints.

00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:39.960
 It's really nice.

00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:42.480
 Like I was teaching my friend how to code

00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:44.200
 and we did a bit of CSS.

00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:47.880
 And, you know, she was kind of like piecing together,

00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:50.320
 seeing how it works and go, okay, yeah, okay.

00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:51.800
 It works on the next day.

00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:53.520
 Our next time we met up, we did Tailwind.

00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:56.160
 And she was like, why didn't you just teach me

00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:57.400
 this, you know?

00:55:57.400 --> 00:55:59.480
 It's just so much more powerful.

00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:02.440
 It's just, you know, I get all the stuff I want.

00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:04.440
 You know, I just go bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:06.800
 What the hell we did last week?

00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:08.560
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:09.400
 And it's funny 'cause again,

00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:11.440
 if you go back to my experience and I was in C#,

00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:12.280
 I had all that.

00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:13.920
 Like I had, I was using Visual Studio,

00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:15.680
 which was like a fantastic IDE

00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:17.120
 with all this stuff built into it.

00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:19.160
 Even like rewrote my code for me when it was inefficient.

00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:21.000
 Like it just was super useful.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.640
 So yeah, we were looking for,

00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:24.640
 okay, what's the best way?

00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:26.200
 What's the best course, what's the best resource

00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:27.160
 you can start with?

00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:30.040
 And everything was very JavaScript focused.

00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:31.600
 And I don't know, just like trying to get her up

00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:33.640
 to speed as fast as possible in both.

00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:34.920
 It just felt like might as well,

00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:36.680
 I wish there was just something that,

00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:38.680
 now we'll just commit a TypeScript from the beginning.

00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:40.680
 - No, I just don't think it exists, actually.

00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:42.000
 I don't think there is something like that.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:43.440
 And it's something I have thought about

00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:47.080
 maybe made resources for or thought about making it.

00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:48.760
 Currently there's not a kind of economic incentive

00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:49.600
 for me to do that.

00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:51.280
 My stuff is not for beginners.

00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:52.120
 You know what I mean?

00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:52.960
 I do have a beginner's course.

00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:55.280
 That's beginners are not where the money is

00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:58.520
 in terms of people who I don't like asking beginners for money.

00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:00.200
 You know, like I want to ask people

00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:02.160
 who have got a job, you know, that kind of thing.

00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:03.400
 There's definitely got to be something there.

00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:05.160
 - Yeah, yeah, just because we looked

00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:08.120
 and obviously something that categories could be free.

00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:10.480
 Like they're to be free resources.

00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:12.400
 But yeah, like there was a lot of really great stuff

00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:15.400
 but no one really committed to TypeScript yet.

00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:17.600
 Yeah, that's cool.

00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:19.280
 - Well, maybe I'll have a bit of free time

00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:21.960
 after this course launches and I can do something else.

00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:23.280
 You know, that's going to be great

00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:25.600
 finishing a massive piece of work and then just.

00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:27.160
 - Oh man, no kidding, 10 months.

00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:28.760
 That's a huge size.

00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:30.840
 You're going to, you're going to close the world's most

00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:33.600
 amount of browser tabs that have ever been closed at once.

00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:34.440
 I'm guessing.

00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:35.920
 - Yeah.

00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:38.680
 - Some baby tabs mixed in there, like changing diapers.

00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:40.600
 - Close my tabs every five minutes.

00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:42.440
 Like it's, I don't know what you're talking about.

00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:45.120
 - I think I might be pretty much unique

00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:47.920
 in that I basically only have one browser tab open at a time.

00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:48.760
 - Yeah, see, exactly.

00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:49.600
 There you go.

00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:50.920
 - What?

00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:53.600
 - You guys are crazy, I am in the norm here.

00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:55.680
 - How do you find anything when you don't?

00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:57.160
 - You don't, you just leave them all open

00:57:57.160 --> 00:57:58.560
 and then eventually you close them up.

00:57:58.560 --> 00:57:59.920
 - Yeah, man.

00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:01.800
 - But I'm like, it's awful.

00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:03.000
 - You were that guy in a student house

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000
 that would never tidy up his, like, you know,

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.280
 you would never do the stuff off to your cook.

00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:08.160
 - No, that's true.

00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:09.000
 - Yeah.

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:12.040
 - Yeah, I am very messy, not very messy.

00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:16.120
 I am extremely organized and precise in my digital world

00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:19.080
 but like, my physical world is nothing like that.

00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:20.720
 It's, I'm actually the opposite.

00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:23.760
 I'm actually pretty physically organized and my digital,

00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:27.360
 like, my downloads folder is an infinitely growing cesspool

00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:29.480
 of everything I ever downloaded and I never touch it.

00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:30.840
 I never delete anything, yeah.

00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:32.160
 - That's funny.

00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:34.160
 - In box infinity, the whole thing.

00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:36.720
 I just, I'm pretty digitally unkempt.

00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:38.440
 - The, the other question I had was,

00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:39.480
 you said you're writing a book.

00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:42.520
 I was always curious about the economics of a book

00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:47.520
 because, so as a consumer, I've never bought a course.

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.760
 I've bought plenty of books,

00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:53.960
 mostly when I am trying to get into a completely new topic

00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:55.600
 and I just need to go as deep as possible

00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:56.520
 to buy the book and read it.

00:58:56.520 --> 00:58:58.960
 I know I have, like, basic coverage of it

00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:03.960
 but books are so cheap and they seem really hard to produce.

00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:07.120
 So do people make any money off of books?

00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:08.160
 Like, how does that all work?

00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:10.560
 - I kind of buried the lead on, on what I was saying before

00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:13.040
 'cause actually we are giving the book away for free.

00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:13.880
 - Oh, I see, okay.

00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:16.600
 - It's, I mean, it is, we're, we do have a print version.

00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:18.640
 - This, yeah, I mean, people do make money off books.

00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:21.240
 You know, like, these are, these are textbook size things.

00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:25.400
 These are, like, retailing for a decent price

00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:27.680
 and obviously as soon as you've made the book,

00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:30.480
 like, I think one of no starches, Bigger Sellers,

00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:35.520
 is just a, basically, a book version

00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:38.360
 of the Rust open source documentation.

00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:39.200
 - Right.

00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:40.040
 - That's one of the biggest sellers

00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:42.080
 and people just like it 'cause they just like the feel of it

00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:44.480
 and they like, it's almost like an aspirational thing,

00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:45.320
 you know what I mean?

00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:47.720
 Like, they buy the book and they think, right,

00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:48.960
 if I just set the book over there,

00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:52.760
 the knowledge will just travel over here.

00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:55.200
 But it is a nice experience, you know, reading a book

00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:56.520
 and taking your pencil to it.

00:59:56.520 --> 00:59:58.040
 - Yeah, I like books in my, oh,

00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:00.640
 I have a whole stack of programming books there.

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:02.560
 - I think developers just have enough money that, you know,

01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:07.040
 they can justify buying or having a whole industry

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:09.200
 that's just taking information on the internet

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:11.600
 and putting it in paper, putting it on dead trees

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:12.440
 and then shipping it.

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:14.840
 - But do you feel like the book that you wrote,

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.520
 does that feel like the same amount of work

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:19.160
 for an equivalent course or was it more work, less work?

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:22.080
 - I finished the course quite a while ago, actually.

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:24.840
 And then writing the book has taken a lot longer.

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:28.040
 I think probably I had the baby at a time

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:30.040
 that meant that writing the book was

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:32.800
 and I tend to find recording videos a lot faster

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:36.040
 than writing, just a lot, lot, lot.

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:37.520
 Because I've got this public speaking background,

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:41.440
 I can do it very, very fast and writing takes a lot longer.

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:43.560
 It's still relatively fast, but I don't know,

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:44.400
 you probably feel the same.

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:45.920
 I feel the same way.

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:48.960
 I feel like if I'm going to spend 100 hours,

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:51.600
 I could like equivalent, of course, versus writing.

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:54.360
 I feel like a course I could definitely get out writing

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:55.720
 seems a lot more challenging.

01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:56.560
 - Yeah.

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:57.400
 - That's what makes me want it.

01:00:57.400 --> 01:00:59.320
 And the course is make so much more,

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:02.400
 or at least it costs so much more per whatever.

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:05.640
 So yeah, like once I, once I clicked for me,

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:07.720
 I was like, how does anyone, like,

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:09.240
 why does anyone even write a book

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:12.280
 when they could just make a course that, you know,

01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:13.280
 that was more or less accurate.

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:15.440
 The reason why we wanted to do it was,

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:18.080
 first of all, it's like, it's cool to have a book.

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:18.920
 You know what I mean?

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:19.760
 - Yeah, it's cool.

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:20.680
 - Some people just want the book.

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:22.760
 And like, it means we can offer something

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:24.960
 that's at a different price point from the courses.

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:27.880
 You know, like obviously we're going to have now,

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:31.080
 like free book, free linked book, you know,

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:32.240
 which is going to be so cool.

01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:34.600
 Great for SEO and stuff, great for inbound stuff.

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:35.960
 People are going to share this all over the place.

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:37.000
 It's going to be awesome.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.680
 Then we've got book, you know,

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:41.160
 however much they sell it for.

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:44.040
 And that's going to be on, that's going to be available

01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:47.120
 in places that are not digital, you know,

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:49.080
 it's going to be like, people will stumble upon that.

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.680
 People will see that on shelves and think,

01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:51.520
 oh, that's interesting.

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:52.640
 I wonder what that is.

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:54.320
 Look it up online, maybe find the course, you know,

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:55.960
 it sort of seeds itself.

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:58.040
 And then we've got mid price course

01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:59.440
 and then high price course.

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:00.920
 That's the kind of offering now.

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:04.280
 And so that's the rationale for the book, I think.

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:05.120
 - Yeah, yeah.

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:07.760
 I mean, even for us, like our company SST,

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:10.240
 the first thing we ever built was a book,

01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:13.120
 actually a free book on how to build serverless applications.

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:17.800
 And over the years, that has gotten crazy SEO to this day.

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:19.360
 Like we still get a crazy amount of traffic,

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:22.240
 just from that, like we haven't really updated it

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:23.440
 as much as it should be.

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:26.040
 And then now there's like real companies

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:27.280
 where when we see their code base, we're like,

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:28.800
 oh, you just took what was in the book.

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:30.760
 And now it's like a company and a code base

01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:31.600
 with people that work there.

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:34.760
 So yeah, it is wild to see that given enough time,

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:37.400
 you watch that whole, whole funnel happen.

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:40.680
 It's slow, but yeah, I totally see why how that works.

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:41.520
 - It really pays off.

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:44.240
 And the internet is built on text, you know what I mean?

01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:46.800
 Like eventually you're gonna need text

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:50.440
 in your portfolio of offerings that you have, you know,

01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:52.600
 emails and blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:55.600
 And it's hard to produce or I find it a lot harder,

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:57.400
 but yeah, you gotta have it.

01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:59.760
 - Well, I'm just dipping a toe in this world now.

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:03.320
 - Just a tiny little toe, I'm just dipping.

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:04.680
 I'm not at 400 videos.

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:08.000
 And every time I hear like you or can't talk about

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.200
 just cranked out 400 videos for the next thing,

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:12.680
 I'm like, oh my gosh, that's so much ahead of me

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:14.040
 and I'm going too slow.

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:16.800
 - You're doing a course?

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:19.240
 - Yeah, I'm doing a pro AWS, I'm working with Joel.

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:21.600
 I'm doing the whole thing.

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:25.360
 I'm just at the very, very, very beginning of that journey.

01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:27.720
 - Happy to have any advice that I can, like, or like--

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:30.880
 - I could just sit here and pepper do the entire podcast,

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:33.320
 but I didn't want to do that for everyone that listens.

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:38.320
 - I might DM you though, you've walked the path

01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:39.760
 that I would like to go.

01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:42.000
 I thoroughly enjoy teaching so far.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:42.960
 It's been fantastic.

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:46.840
 I've done one live workshop and I absolutely love it.

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:47.920
 So I hope--

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:50.200
 - You're doing the journey, yeah, yeah.

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:52.560
 - I'm doing it, yeah, we'll see.

01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:55.800
 But man, a lot of videos ahead, the 400, that's a lot.

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:58.400
 - Every video, literally, if it's like a five minute video,

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.960
 it takes like seven minutes to record, you know what I mean?

01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:04.840
 It's basically just me reacting to code samples,

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:07.360
 talking through stuff, like mostly it's like,

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:10.000
 I have this set up, if you've ever done any of my courses

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.840
 where I set up a problem and then show my solution.

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:16.120
 And talking about the problem,

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:17.760
 it's literally just talking about code, you know what I mean?

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:19.760
 So I just hit record, hit on record.

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:22.160
 I've got a script that automatically cuts the silence

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:23.800
 off the start and end of the videos

01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:25.680
 and then saves it in the right folder and back.

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:27.520
 - Yeah, I've actually seen, I think I've read

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:30.960
 the whole case study that they put on that as dev.

01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:33.120
 I've read your, like, I've read your process.

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:35.880
 So I maybe have fewer questions than you'd be,

01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:38.400
 than you would expect because I've kind of like

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:39.640
 poured over the material.

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:41.720
 It takes me, currently I'm not taking your advice

01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:44.760
 'cause it takes me about 35 minutes to make five minutes

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:45.600
 of video. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:47.240
 - Like, I'm so slow.

01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:49.160
 - People really, I've got to like get over that.

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:50.920
 - People really like fewer cuts, actually.

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:53.520
 That's what I've learned is people really like it just,

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:55.160
 just like say the thing.

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:58.320
 It's like they're, you know, they're programming with you.

01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:00.160
 You know, it's like you're just on the course of it

01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:01.760
 and it feels more natural, I think.

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:03.160
 And people really dig that.

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:05.120
 And people can just speed up your voice as well, you know?

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:06.680
 Like a lot of people, I think, just do the course

01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:08.320
 on 1.5 or whatever.

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:09.520
 Yeah. - Yep.

01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:11.080
 - Oh, that's great. - Yeah, no, I'm excited.

01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:12.920
 It's, I mean, Joel's great.

01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:16.320
 Like having that crew, just the way they think about this stuff

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:18.040
 and they've gone down this past so many times

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.520
 that they just kind of can tell me what to do, sort of.

01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:22.400
 I mean, they say they're not your boss, but like,

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:23.680
 I need somebody to tell me, like,

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:24.920
 "This is what you should do next."

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:27.760
 And that's so helpful to me because if I did it on my own,

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:29.920
 they would take me even longer than it's already taken.

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:31.520
 But people at home, that's badass.dev.

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:33.360
 They've got maybe one of the nicest landing pages

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:35.720
 I've ever seen. - Yes, it's so good.

01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:36.560
 - It's so nice.

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:38.160
 And like, I've never been to Joel's house,

01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:40.720
 but I think the landing page was basically inspired

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:42.320
 by his desk. - Yeah.

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:44.000
 - Like, it's-- - I've seen the pictures

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.720
 of this famous office. - It's a sane level

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:50.080
 of impacts and weird stuff and like, just loads of weird stuff.

01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:53.320
 And yeah, I think, I've, I just felt like a,

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:56.560
 I felt like a passenger in a Formula One car.

01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:57.400
 You know what I mean?

01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:01.240
 Like, they would just drive in to go back to a previous thing.

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:03.960
 - Can we go back to the anal beads?

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:06.200
 Is there any way it could pull that back in?

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.200
 - We could. - We'll put that back in.

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:08.960
 - I thought you'd get that signal.

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:10.480
 And we would circle back to it.

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:12.680
 And that would be the end of the podcast.

01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:14.320
 And like-- - That is not dev.

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:16.720
 It's like being in a formula car with anal beads

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:17.920
 at the same time. - And anal beads

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:19.320
 that vibrate, yeah, yeah. - That's it.

01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:20.440
 You get the grooves in your mind,

01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:22.360
 you know, you put the VR headset on,

01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:24.840
 and you just looked in, is that part of the setup?

01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:26.400
 I don't know. - Oh!

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:27.880
 - Matt, thank you so much for coming on.

01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:30.400
 This was so great. - I just, I had a great punchline

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:33.480
 which only Dax would get which is like force feedback.

01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:35.480
 But, you know. - Oh, there we go.

01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:37.040
 (laughing)

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:38.200
 I don't get that. - Take care.

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:39.400
 - You're right. (laughing)

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:41.200
 - Please don't have that thing, it was Oryx.

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:43.400
 (laughing)

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:44.560
 - Oh, it's great to talk with you guys.

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:46.880
 - Yeah. - Yeah, great to have you.

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:47.720
 - Cool.

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:49.680
 All right, well, yeah, anything else to say?

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:50.520
 It's a plug.

01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:52.040
 - Ah, you let me plug beautifully.

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:52.880
 Thank you so much.

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:55.320
 And, yeah, plug.

01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:56.320
 - If you're interested in TypeScript--

01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:57.600
 - I guess the new course.

01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:59.000
 - Yeah, TotalTypeScript.com.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.720
 It's gonna, all the new stuff will be there.

01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:02.000
 Is that right? - Yeah, so TypeScript.com.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.600
 There's, I mean, I've written maybe 60, 70 articles

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:07.080
 on their free tutorials on there.

01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:10.640
 I'm gonna be doing a lot more stuff on the newsletter as well

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:12.800
 and doing less on socials more on the newsletter.

01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:14.840
 So, yeah, that's nice and cool.

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:15.680
 - All right, thanks again.

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:17.360
 We don't really have a way to get off here.

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:19.120
 We just, we say bye.

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:20.200
 Bye.

01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:21.280
 - All right, thanks for coming, bye.

01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:22.120
 - Bye.

01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:23.280
 - Bye, thanks, bye.

01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:25.860
 (upbeat music)

01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:37.440
 - I'm sorry, what now?
