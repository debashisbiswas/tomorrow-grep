WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640
 We can talk about real stuff anytime you want.

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:02.340
 This is real stuff.

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.100
 This is real.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.040
 This is the Typecraft's Fears Hour.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.600
 Adam's not very well traveled.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.700
 He's never left Missouri.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.920
 Never left Missouri.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:36.920
 That's not true.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.120
 Who was in the city then?

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.640
 Who did I see?

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.880
 He's never seen the ocean.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.160
 I've actually been to Connecticut.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.440
 Oh, really?

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.640
 Well, I drove through New Haven, New London, just on the coast.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.360
 We drove from Boston to New York once.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.600
 So. Oh, nice.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.360
 Yeah, nice.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.040
 I came and pictured you on the East Coast.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.320
 That's so weird.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.600
 You literally hung out with me multiple times on the East Coast.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.320
 No, I know, but like driving from Boston to whatever, that's like a very

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.840
 New England situation.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.360
 Yeah, I didn't drive my parents drove.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.440
 So when I was in high school, my senior year high school, me and my

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.720
 brother had this favorite band called Dispatch.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.520
 Nice.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.040
 They were like really, really big in the natural era.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.160
 Yeah, that's just digging it.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.320
 OK, so we went to the last dispatch, which was in Boston.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.080
 My parents drove us from the Ozarks to Boston.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.240
 We drove.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.360
 It was a lot.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.720
 Yeah.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.840
 Is that cheaper than flying?

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.280
 I don't know.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.600
 My parents just don't fly that we never flew.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.080
 Growing up.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.480
 I don't know.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.880
 There was a pilot now.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:37.880
 Yeah.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.880
 Damn.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.360
 That's awesome.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.840
 That's rebellion right there.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.840
 Exactly.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.840
 I don't mind driving my problem.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.640
 And this is going to sound really crazy is I cannot drive over large bridges.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.160
 Oh, interesting.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.640
 I have a sincere fear of heights on bridges, specifically when driving.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.240
 If I'm the passenger, it's lovely.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.840
 I look out.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.760
 It's just a nice, like, experience, but driving something about it.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.280
 That call, like, to the void of, like, you're going to steer this way and go

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.280
 straight off the bridge.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.920
 I don't know what that is.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.080
 I can't can't do it.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.640
 I totally relate.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.200
 At some point, probably right when I was like becoming an adult, I had the same

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.000
 thing, which is with heights in general, where I was just having to go near

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.320
 something high, my brain would just be like, hey, how far can you lean over

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.240
 without falling over?

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.360
 And that just freaked me out.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.040
 Yeah, and it's at the point now where, like, most heights are okay.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.800
 But then one of my friends, there's a lot of buildings in Miami that are crazy

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.320
 tall and everyone has a balcony.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.960
 And when I like go out there, I feel like the ground is not stable.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.760
 Like it's, it's like really impacting me where I feel like any moment, I'm just

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.360
 going to, like, lose my balance and go over the edge.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.000
 So I can, I can relate to that.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.400
 It's funny.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.000
 It's like, it's not just a mental, like issue.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.320
 It's also like physical, you know, like, you physically cannot do the thing

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.760
 or you feel like you're going to fall over a passout or whatever.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.520
 Like I went to a wedding in Ireland, which was, I mean, beautiful country.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.400
 I did not know how mountainous the west of Ireland is.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.240
 It's very like mountainous and their wedding was on top of what you would

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.920
 probably consider like just a large like hill, like not really even a mountain

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.760
 so much, but like the way everything was set up and driving up it, I couldn't go

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.840
 to the actual ceremony because I got too, too much anxiety.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.200
 I had to like stop and like sort of hang on the parking lot and then meet

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.800
 everyone else at the hotel at the bottom of the, of the mountain.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.560
 So it's like, it's like extreme.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.520
 It gets better.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.880
 Yeah.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.160
 I, it's like, I said, it's like a physical thing.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.080
 Like I physically think I'm going to pass out and like, I don't know what it is.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.800
 Like it's just, it's just crazy fears.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.640
 Like I can't stop my mind from saying like you're driving this car, like at

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.920
 this crazy incline.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.640
 And at some point you're going to, I don't know, hit a rock and the whole

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.000
 car just falls right off the mountain.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 Right.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.880
 Like that's, that's what happens in my mind.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.560
 I don't know how to, I don't know how to turn that off.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.120
 It's all right.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.640
 No, it is a really physical thing.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.360
 It happened as an adult.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.440
 I did not have this fear until I was like 25.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.880
 Yeah.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:02.800
 Oh, really?

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.240
 Yeah.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.400
 That's when your frontal lobe develops and you're no longer in it.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.960
 It's true.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:08.160
 Yeah.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.880
 Maybe that's it.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:09.960
 That could be it.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.440
 No, I'm afraid of heights.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.760
 There's like normal afraid of heights.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.680
 And I try, I can't remember the last time I was in a situation where I had to be

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.480
 afraid because I just avoid tall things, I guess.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.480
 I don't leave the answer.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:20.840
 Yes.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:21.720
 That's the key.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.720
 You are a tall thing.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.240
 OK, both of you, I think.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.320
 Yeah, I'm surprisingly tall.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.720
 You do surprisingly.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.320
 Surprising.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.800
 I don't know.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.840
 I feel like anytime I meet someone around my height, it's surprising.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.160
 So yeah, yeah, I love your backdrop.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.280
 I love all of your content.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.360
 I love the things you make.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.080
 I don't say that to be.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.640
 Oh, thank you.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:42.480
 No, sure.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.320
 Yeah, I don't like the word content.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.320
 It just, yeah, your stuff just started popping up on my stuff.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.160
 Like just the internet throw stuff at me and then it's just started

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.640
 throwing your stuff at me more recently and I watch a bunch of your like terminal

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.480
 related stuff, like some of the new stuff, some of the, I think, T muck stuff.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.320
 I can't remember exactly.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.800
 But yeah, great background.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.480
 I had vibes.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.400
 I stole it from Aaron Francis.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.320
 I didn't think the pain.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.200
 I didn't steal from him.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.080
 I so the thing I've been telling myself to make me feel better is that I did have

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.600
 pegboard.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.360
 I think before he did his office thing, but my, I had like a different angle,

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.320
 like from here, I didn't have as much stuff.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.480
 And then when I saw his setup, I was like, Oh my God, I'm so close to that.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.440
 I just got more over here.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.040
 And then I'm good.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.960
 And so that was, that was kind of the evolution of it.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.280
 But yeah, I think I'm happy with it.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.760
 Have you guys seen that dream studio company?

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.800
 No, yeah, Kevin.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.120
 Yeah, I think maybe.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.800
 So I can't see Dodgers posted about it, but so they originally made a course on

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.280
 like how to make a nice studio and like they cover every part of it, lighting,

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.600
 background, camera stuff.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.080
 But now you can just hire them.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.280
 And they come to your place and they like do it all for you.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.240
 They think to design your thing with like this lens of it's called dream studio.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.920
 And that's pretty cool.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.800
 It's crazy to me that because we've been talking about this SST, how like

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:14.080
 just making stuff has gotten so much easier in a lot of ways that if you're

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.480
 someone with any amount of expertise, you can just like, you can just also do

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.200
 this thing where you're like making content for people.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.160
 To the point where there's now is an entire company that just helps people

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.520
 set up studios and that's like it seems like a thriving business.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.720
 That's super cool.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.040
 Yeah, no, this is all trial and error.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:34.760
 And it's funny, like even when you have a good setup and I'm sure you guys have

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.360
 probably experienced this, it's like you have a good setup, but like it just

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.680
 doesn't look right and then you have like a nice camera, but you don't know how to

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.480
 make the settings look just right.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.600
 And like, you know, this microphone like didn't sound great at first.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.520
 You have to get like a cloud lifter type thing.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.800
 Cause it says this microphone was the worst thing ever.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.240
 It's like it's so it's actually horrible by default.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.400
 And then you have to like get a cloud lifter and then you have to process the

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.120
 shit out of it.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.320
 And then it sounds pretty good.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.560
 But wow, I did not expect that when I started.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.480
 Yeah, it's it is it's everything is shittier than you assume it is because

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.800
 like I'm coming from the outside.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.120
 You look at these people with like these really nice setup and you're like, wow,

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.880
 that looks awesome.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.520
 And you're like, all I have to do is get this, this and this.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.480
 And like I should like have the same thing.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.280
 And then you get them and you're like, Oh, no, it's actually like a many hours

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.680
 of trial and error and setting it up.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.640
 And like what are the settings?

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:22.560
 It's crazy.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.920
 Like just buying like a lav mic.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.000
 I have a lav mic for a couple of videos we did.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.600
 Just those settings took me hours.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.000
 Cause like I set it up.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.160
 I download some software.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.400
 I'm like, I get it all set up.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.760
 And then, and then you hook it up to the camera and it comes out.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:42.520
 And the sound just like, and so you have to look at that and like, what the

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:48.320
 hell is this? And so it turns out cameras also have their own sort

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.040
 of gain that they put on things.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.960
 So you have to turn down the cameras game so that the lav mic is coming

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.840
 through more pure and it's like, it's just insane.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.360
 Like this, all of this is so difficult.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.600
 I love making videos.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.560
 I hate the setup of it.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.320
 Yeah.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.720
 The expectation is just risen and risen, right?

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:11.440
 Like I think YouTube, every, every like video is high quality now.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:16.640
 So if you don't have all these things, it just kind of like stands out in a bad way.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.440
 It used to be like, I remember when the zoom era, like COVID and the pandemic,

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:24.440
 everybody got a camera and it was like, Oh, you should have a better zoom appearance.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.400
 But now it's just gone to like crazy degrees.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.120
 Yeah, you've got set design behind you.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.280
 I mean, it's just like, where does it end?

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:31.800
 Yeah.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.320
 Yeah.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:36.560
 I miss the days where all the content on YouTube was like from like an angle down

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:36.920
 here.

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:37.440
 Yeah.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.680
 Backbook.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.840
 Just looking up the nose, I wish I could be one of those people.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.880
 I wish I could be one of the people that just like, it's about the content.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.360
 And I'm just going to look terrible and it's going to be like grainy and awful audio.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.960
 But like people are going to love it because I'm awesome, but I can't.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.560
 I just go like, I'm not awesome.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.240
 I have a good camera.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.280
 Turns out I'm pretty boring.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.040
 I go for it.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:58.320
 Yeah.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.280
 No, it's funny.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.560
 Yeah, that's, I think that's a lot I had to overcome too.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.480
 It's like, I have to make stuff look good because I don't think I'm, I think I'm

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.440
 all that other than that, you know, people like, you know,

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:14.400
 prime, obviously, like so, so, so entertaining that like he doesn't, you don't even have

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.840
 to see him and he's just entertained by what he's saying.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.080
 Cause he's so fun and funny.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:22.480
 And like, I feel like I'm a very calm, like muted kind of personality.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.680
 So I have to have like this stuff to like actually stand out.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:26.280
 You know what I mean?

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:26.520
 Yeah.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:27.600
 You got to play your friends.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:32.440
 I did learn a new word recently that I'm sorry, Adam, but you're the first

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.840
 person I thought of when I heard this word.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.560
 Oh, man.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.480
 You might have seen this post was a post on Twitter that was like, we need a name

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:42.520
 for someone that is new to a hobby and buys all the best equipment by the way.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:45.840
 That's what we're buying being like, Oh, this already exists.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.800
 It's called a by hard.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:54.320
 And I was like, oh, my God, that's literally Adam.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.280
 Adam's a by hard.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.240
 Oh hell.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.280
 Yeah, I love that.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.680
 It's fun.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:03.400
 I get into stuff, you know, anything I take on, it's like you just get into it and you

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:07.080
 want to, you want to look the part, you want to own all the stuff and then go from there.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.880
 But it is like that feeling like Typecraft said you buy a thing and you think, like,

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:11.400
 this is easy.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.080
 I bought the thing.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.280
 And that's like, Oh, no, I have to actually learn how to use the thing.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.240
 Yeah, that part sucks.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:16.560
 Yeah.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.000
 That's the hardest.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:18.360
 Yeah.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.360
 It's like it doesn't just come out of the box looking good.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.520
 It actually was worse than the easier choice.

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.960
 Yeah, exactly.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.680
 Also, I don't know if you guys can tell.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:29.240
 So I mess with my camera, assuming like this stuff, my camera color setting,

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.760
 like my white balance setting, like a long time ago, maybe like six months ago,

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.560
 and it's never felt like fixing it throughout this call.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.920
 I will go from being looking very orange to looking completely pale.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.160
 It's just constantly shifting.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.440
 Like right now I'm like going towards the orange side.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.880
 I then it'll just randomly start to like make me pale again.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:49.880
 So like you have like other light coming in that's unpredictable or is it?

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.600
 I don't know what it is at all.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.720
 Cause it's like I'm in a dark room with the window closed.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.960
 So I have no idea.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.040
 I wouldn't worry about that.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:03.920
 I'm going to go from kind of red to very red because I'm in a small home

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:07.800
 office and like I can't stop the heat coming out from here.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.480
 So like it's just going to get warmer and warmer and the camera might shut off.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.120
 You know, we'll see.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.000
 Yeah, that does remind me for sure.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:15.880
 That does remind me.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.480
 Oh, looks like I'm really orange now.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.840
 I have a fan for the camera.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.440
 Let me just install it real quick.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.240
 Oh, just going off.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.080
 Yeah, it's a cool.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:23.560
 Yeah.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.240
 Yep.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.320
 Oh, please, please.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:30.400
 Oh, these are real problems for the point one percent of the camera.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.360
 That is so crazy.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:36.040
 I have an a seven for the overheats when I have to have to do things.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.000
 I have not shut off my camera in like a year.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.120
 Just leave it on all the time.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.720
 Yeah, really.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.840
 This is the other thing too.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:44.320
 And it's funny.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:48.720
 Like this whole discussion we're having like just kind of falls right into line

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.000
 with this too is like you get a nice camera.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.080
 It's a DSLR.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:55.160
 We have the Sony a 6700 is really nice.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.320
 But you set it up and you're like, oh, let me do a stream.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:58.600
 Oh, wow.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.400
 Look how good I look.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.560
 Let's go on like Twitch for a little while.

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:04.360
 And then your camera just shuts off in a half an hour and you're like, oh, my God.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:10.200
 It just cannot handle like the heat it generates when it's like live like, you know, just the

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:14.360
 signals going right to the computer capture card and the camera is just not built for

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.360
 that.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:21.520
 So again, yeah, there's just a million combinations of equipment and settings and you realize

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:22.520
 on Linux.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.920
 So I'm like playing on hard mode.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:25.920
 Yeah.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:26.920
 Are you on Linux now?

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:27.920
 I've been on Linux forever.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:28.920
 Oh, hell yeah.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:29.920
 I didn't know that.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:34.340
 I've actually had a massive joke because I say everything I say that I've been doing

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:38.440
 has been for 10 years because I basically wasn't doing any 10 years before that I was

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.840
 like a child before that.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:40.840
 Not really.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:41.840
 That's awesome.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:46.120
 I always assumed since you are a JavaScript JavaScript guy that you're a bad guy.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:50.120
 I don't know why I just like that's a strong correlation with me.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.120
 Yeah.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.480
 Yeah, it makes sense.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:58.880
 It's funny because I'm actually for the first time using more Mac stuff like I got a MacBook

00:12:58.880 --> 00:12:59.880
 as my laptop.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:04.580
 And I just haven't used a laptop in a long time and I finally like added that to my workflow.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:08.200
 But I just ask the station to my Linux server and do everything there.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.200
 Oh, yeah.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.200
 I love that.

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.200
 The hardware, which I think is great.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.840
 Also in this set, I've taught us a bunch of I'm gonna say it again because all my development

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.640
 is remote.

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:21.800
 The MacBook, which already has crazy good battery life, gets like insane battery life

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:26.280
 because literally doing nothing like I can use it for like two days without having to

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.280
 charge it.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:28.280
 It's like it's really wild.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:29.740
 So I'm really happy about that.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.800
 But yeah, everything I do is still my next.

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:32.800
 And it's funny.

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:37.120
 Like I am a JavaScript person, but all I do is write go because a lot of the tooling is

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.120
 written and go.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.360
 I'm actually right that much.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.360
 That was good.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.800
 Oh, very cool.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:47.160
 I like I love the idea of having a MacBook where you just you develop elsewhere.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:53.400
 I got obsessed with this whole concept of like a thin client for years like years ago.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:58.080
 I made like before I ever did any videos, made a whole blog post on and stuff.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.120
 And I had this set up.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:04.880
 Does anyone remember the Google Pixel Slate, the tablet they came up with?

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:05.880
 I do remember that.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:06.880
 Yeah.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:11.720
 So it was just powerful enough that you could have like it still ran the full oh my God,

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:18.160
 what the Chrome OS, you know, and had just enough on it where you could open a terminal

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.520
 and SSH to a client.

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:23.080
 I had a digital ocean droplet somewhere that would SSH into.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:26.600
 And that was actually like my work computer for like a couple of years.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:30.680
 I went a little bit crazy with it, but but no, I love I love the concept of like the thin

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:31.680
 clients.

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:32.680
 It's I think that's really cool.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:36.000
 So you said you have a video because I was just producing your YouTube before we got

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 on here.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.360
 I don't do research for the show, but I just I like you and I was like, I want to see

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.360
 type press page.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.360
 I like you guys too.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.360
 Yeah.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:48.680
 I saw a video you did one on this idea of what Dax does of like remotely, like should

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:53.600
 I remotely SSH into my machine or whatever, basically this concept.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.600
 I need both of you.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.720
 I didn't watch a video because I didn't have time.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.840
 And Dax, I've probably heard you say it, but I forgot.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:14:59.840
 Could you sell me?

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:02.040
 Why should I not just do this on my local machine?

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:06.600
 Like I just run Tmux on my Mac and that's like when I shut down my Mac, it's all gone

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.600
 and I started back up.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.600
 Is that the main benefit?

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.600
 I could just keep it up all the time.

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:11.600
 That's one.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.600
 Yeah.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:15.560
 Like I literally my sessions are always up when I switch from my desktop to my Macbook.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:20.360
 It's just it's like it's literally on the same file, the cursor in the exact same position

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.520
 I was just in.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.920
 My computer reboots, whatever, like it's I don't have to rebuild anything.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.320
 I also have like have Tmux saving all that anyway.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:32.560
 So if I do need to bring it back up, it's it's it's it comes back to this similar spot.

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:37.560
 But for me, my whole issue was just this I've always built my own computers, me too, with

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:43.480
 this like for again, forever my logic was I'm going to build this computer because I can

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.200
 upgrade the parts one by one.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.200
 Sorry.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:48.000
 I can just get the CPU later.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.120
 I've never done that because by the time I wanted to see you, oh, the socket.

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.120
 Yeah.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.120
 The socket change.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.120
 I'm going to get it.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.520
 If I'm going to get a new motherboard, I might as well get the new RAM for it.

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.280
 So I effectively just never did that.

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.560
 And what's worse is I'm horrible at like selling stuff.

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:06.680
 So I'm like, I don't even I'm just not going to efficiently get rid of this.

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:12.040
 So I just got tired of the hardware upgrades and it's funny because unfortunately JavaScript

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.600
 tooling is extremely slow.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:17.880
 So as completely bottlenecked by a single core performance and I work on some like really

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:23.360
 like heavy typed code bases where their libraries are using them, it's fine, but you're working

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.120
 on library itself, like things can get pretty slow.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:32.040
 So for me, like having the fastest single core CPU, like makes a difference.

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:36.960
 And when I if I can rent that every year, somebody else deals with the hardware upgrade.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:42.000
 They like, you know, buy the new stuff put together, they know how to recycle the old

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.840
 stuff or like find a way to like, you know, lower the price and sell to someone else to

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:46.840
 an efficient thing.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:50.440
 You know, and I just pay like a fixed monthly price for that forever.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:53.440
 And right now I'm using this like crazy server from reliable site.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:17:00.480
 It's like the like the highest rise in AMD CPU right now called reliable site or a reliable

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:01.480
 site.

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:02.480
 No, it's called a Bible.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:07.920
 So that's definitely fair about this because they give us to me for free so I can talk about

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:08.920
 them.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:14.700
 I just say it very clearly, like the site dot coms, reliable site, the name is just funny

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:15.700
 to me.

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:19.280
 Yeah, like, like now I think they're unreliable.

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.280
 I don't know.

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.280
 I'm sorry.

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.280
 I don't want to say it.

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.280
 Trust me.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.280
 Believe me.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.280
 Believe me.

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.280
 Guys, totally reliable.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.280
 Don't worry about it.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.280
 Yeah.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.280
 We're good.

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.280
 Yeah.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.280
 Yeah.

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.280
 No, those are all good things.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.280
 And I agree.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:37.000
 And that's that was my that was my draw to that whole thing as well.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:43.200
 The other thing for me was you can have whatever computer you want to be the thing that you

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:47.080
 use to connect to your actual like computation in the cloud or whatever.

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.080
 Right.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.080
 So for me, that was like the experiment.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:53.400
 I was like, can I just use like this, this shitty tablet that Google released that then

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:59.360
 they dropped like two years later, it's so stupid, but they cancel products so often.

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:00.360
 It's crazy.

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.360
 But yeah, like that's, that's the other cool things.

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:06.520
 Like, if I break this, you know, I have a Mac mini actually, no, this is a great example.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:12.840
 I have a Lenovo PC that we bought to make videos and to stream.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.120
 I'm not using it right now because it broke.

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:16.120
 It just broke.

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:17.120
 I don't know what it is.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.760
 Maybe like the memory broke, maybe motherboard.

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:23.440
 Now, I guess it's a different use case, but the idea is with like thin client, like, you

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:27.800
 don't care if your stuff breaks because it was just the $200 piece of crap hardware, you

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:28.800
 just get another one.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:29.800
 It's not a big deal.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:34.440
 You know, and then I guess I do spend a lot of time keeping my Mac studio at my desktop

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:40.760
 computer and my Mac book in sync, like I had to push my dot file changes and do all this

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:41.760
 stuff.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.960
 And if I had it all on one central location, that makes sense.

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:46.400
 According to Twitter, Nick's will fix that for you.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.800
 Nick's, Nick's will fix that.

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:49.800
 It will.

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:50.800
 It will.

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:51.800
 You get it.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:52.800
 You set it up.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:53.800
 You learn it.

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:54.800
 And then one month later, you forget how it works entirely.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:58.000
 And you can never update anything again until you spend another relearning.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 Yeah.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 That's true.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 This is basically my name.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.280
 You have other people use it so you can like, you know, yeah, that's true.

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:05.280
 Get some help.

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.280
 Yeah.

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:07.280
 No, next is, next is wild.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.280
 It's so good.

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:12.320
 It's such a good idea packaged in like the worst product decisions ever.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:15.400
 And so tragic to me because it could be great and it could be something that every single

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.400
 developer uses.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.600
 But I see the potential too.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:18.600
 I totally see it.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:22.480
 And it's just like, yeah, having like this declarative way to say like, I want all this

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.240
 stuff on my machine.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:27.240
 And then so you can just move that to another machine and then just installs everything that

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.240
 needs.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.720
 And it's all like the same exact set up like that makes so much sense about like flakes.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:39.040
 RA RA unstable, you know, like not a, not a, not a, um, oh, sort of, it's not like a one

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:40.040
 dot or lease.

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.040
 Like it's still a beta thing.

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:46.720
 And that's the whole entire ecosystem of Nix relies on an unstable like piece of the

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:47.720
 software.

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:51.360
 And so it's just in like the documentations all over the place.

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:54.960
 You read up on one piece of documentation, but it's like actually, you know, six months

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:55.960
 old.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:59.120
 So it's like a whole different syntax now and like it's, it's, it's just all over the

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.120
 place.

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:01.120
 It's hard.

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:04.920
 You guys talking bad about Nix, they gave me Nix for free.

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:08.600
 If I talk about them, I just, I just appreciate on your sponsor.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:12.540
 And by the way, they're totally reliable, reliable.

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:13.540
 Yeah.

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:14.540
 That's funny.

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:21.200
 So Adam, you should, you should consider just, uh, I mean, you want to try it out.

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:26.400
 Just make your Mac studio the, uh, the server and try to say change from your, yeah, I guess

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:30.280
 that's the thing I should make because I just put a Mac mini in my server rack.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.480
 Do you guys, do you do a home lab?

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.000
 I know Dax says, typecraft, you know, I don't.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 Okay.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.560
 So I have, that was when I was a lot younger, but I haven't done that in a long time.

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.080
 Me and Dax have recently, I don't know how recently you did that.

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:42.080
 I've been on and off.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:44.600
 Like I originally started with the rack of servers and my parents basement.

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:45.600
 That's my bad.

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:46.600
 That's a 10 years ago.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:47.600
 I gave me.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:48.600
 Yeah.

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:49.600
 Yeah.

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.600
 So what do you, what do you use the home lab for?

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:51.600
 What's the, uh, what do you test?

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:56.040
 He can't say, he can't say publicly because it's illegal, but you can infer, that sounds

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:57.040
 awful.

00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:05.400
 Okay, I'm just dealing some Wi-Fi passwords, don't worry about it.

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.280
 Uh, no, I use a brother stuff.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:10.040
 I used to use, uh, I can't remember anything else.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:14.700
 There's definitely some other stuff, I hope, I had a pie hole.

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:15.700
 Yeah.

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:16.700
 Yeah.

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:17.700
 Oh, you guys got me all thrown off.

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:18.700
 No, no, no.

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:19.700
 You're serving up media.

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:20.700
 You're just serving up media.

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:21.700
 That's awesome.

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:22.700
 It's not legal.

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:23.700
 Yeah.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:24.700
 So serve up some media.

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:25.700
 How big deal?

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:26.700
 Yeah.

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:28.180
 Because I had an old one.

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:29.380
 I'm using a Mac studio now.

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:30.660
 Did you get the new one?

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:31.660
 No, no, no, no.

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:32.660
 This is my, like the machine.

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:33.660
 It's even one.

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:34.660
 Yeah.

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:35.660
 Yeah.

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:38.300
 So it's nearly, not nearly as powerful as my current desktop, but I'd have to switch

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:39.300
 them.

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:42.980
 If I do this server setup, I'd want to put my powerful one in the server rack and use

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:44.220
 my dumb one out here, right?

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.420
 You don't have to physically move anything around at all.

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:49.660
 Cause like, why do you have to physically move your studio into the server?

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:51.700
 As it would be a server computer.

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:57.180
 It doesn't have to be in the server rack.

00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:00.380
 I'm sure you start a bunch of stuff to plug into it, like all your mics and cameras and

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:01.380
 stuff.

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:02.380
 So I don't know if you can really switch it.

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:03.380
 Well, then what would change?

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:04.380
 I'm so confused.

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:05.380
 What I actually be using.

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.380
 Listen, I have to use it.

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:08.380
 I have to use it.

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:09.380
 Yeah.

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:10.380
 I don't know what to tell you.

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:11.380
 It's still a server.

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:15.060
 If it's not a server rack, Adam, just as a stage into your Mac studio from your Mac book.

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:16.060
 Oh, that's.

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:19.260
 I don't know how often use your Mac book either, but I do sometimes last night I sat

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:20.660
 in the bath with my Mac book.

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:21.660
 Is that weird?

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:22.660
 Do you guys ever do that?

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:26.340
 I think I think taking a bath is weird as in general.

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:30.380
 The Mac book is kind of a different thing.

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:33.180
 I think that works fine.

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:34.180
 I take baths.

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:36.300
 I mean, only like for enjoyment.

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:37.820
 I don't take them to clean myself.

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:38.820
 Right.

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:39.820
 Okay.

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:40.820
 That makes sense.

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:41.820
 Yeah.

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:42.820
 Yeah.

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:43.820
 I take a shower every night.

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:44.820
 I take a shower right after I take a bath.

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:45.820
 Oh cool.

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:46.820
 Get all sweaty and gross on a bath.

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:47.820
 You turn it up real hot.

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:48.820
 Anyway.

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:49.820
 Yeah.

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:50.820
 I use my Mac book some, but I use it a lot more.

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:51.820
 I use it a lot more.

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:52.820
 I use it a lot more.

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:53.820
 I use it a lot more.

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:54.820
 I use it a lot more.

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:55.820
 I use it a lot more.

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:56.820
 I use it a lot more.

00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:57.820
 I use it a lot more.

00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:58.820
 I use it a lot more.

00:22:58.820 --> 00:22:59.820
 I use it a lot more.

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:00.820
 I use it a lot more.

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:01.820
 I use it a lot more.

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:02.820
 I use it a lot more.

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:03.820
 I use it a lot more.

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:04.820
 I use it a lot more.

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:05.820
 I use it a lot more.

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:06.820
 I use it a lot more.

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:07.820
 I use it a lot more.

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:08.820
 I use it a lot more.

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:09.820
 I use it a lot more.

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:10.820
 I use it a lot more.

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:11.820
 I use it a lot more.

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:12.820
 I use it a lot more.

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:13.820
 I use it a lot more.

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:14.820
 I use it a lot more.

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:15.820
 Okay.

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:22.820
 Let's play in the battery.

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:23.820
 I think this comes together.

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:24.820
 Nice guy.

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:25.820
 I just don't want to use Mac OS.

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:26.820
 That was another reason why I.

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:27.820
 You lost on my last part.

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:28.820
 I love Mac OS.

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:30.820
 But everything else I'm spot on.

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:31.820
 Mac hardware.

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:32.820
 Great.

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:33.820
 It's excellent.

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:35.820
 Mac OS is a lot easier to use than Windows.

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:37.820
 It is a lot easier to use than Windows.

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:38.820
 Analytics.

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:39.820
 Windows is full of ads now.

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:41.820
 I feel like because I do a boot.

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.820
 I go into Windows when I play games and stuff.

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:47.820
 Again, I don't even do that anymore because I now remote for that as well.

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:50.820
 It's just full of ads.

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:53.820
 You open anything and just an ad for something everywhere.

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:55.820
 When did this happen to Windows?

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:57.820
 Why is it just always trying to get me to buy some random thing?

00:23:57.820 --> 00:23:58.820
 It's horrible.

00:23:58.820 --> 00:23:59.820
 It feels really weird.

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:00.820
 Windows is terrible.

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:05.820
 I use a PC for a little while for the streaming and stuff now I'm on the Mac studio.

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:06.820
 But yeah, no.

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:08.820
 When I had the PC up and running, I was using it.

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:11.820
 I had the same problems, all ads and stuff.

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:13.820
 Somebody put it really well on Twitter.

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:16.820
 It was the most perfect definition of what happens with Windows.

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:21.820
 Every couple of days or so, if you restart it, it'll act like it's the first time it booted

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:22.820
 up.

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:26.820
 I still install all these updates and tell you all about the new stuff.

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:28.820
 I know what the fuck I'm doing here.

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:31.820
 I just open OBS.

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:33.820
 Let's go.

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:35.820
 It's so true.

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:36.820
 Windows is just so odd.

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:38.820
 It's like, do you want to use Bing?

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:40.820
 Are you sure you definitely don't need Chrome?

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:42.820
 You can use Internet Explorer or Edge for sure.

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:45.820
 Then they're selling you their cloud drive thing.

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:50.820
 It definitely installed a -- this sounds like such a boomer thing to happen to me.

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:57.620
 But it definitely installed on Chrome something that made -- because I just search -- I just

00:24:57.620 --> 00:24:59.820
 go into the what the --

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:00.820
 The URL bar.

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:01.820
 Yeah.

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:02.820
 The URL bar.

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:03.820
 Yeah.

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:04.820
 And I just type for searching, right?

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:07.820
 And it always defaults to Google or whatever I'm using -- not Bing.

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:08.820
 We'll see the other one.

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:09.820
 Dr. Go.

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:10.820
 Yeah.

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:14.820
 And something happened where Chrome was all of a sudden using Yahoo for search.

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:16.820
 I was like, what happened?

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:19.820
 I threw that on Twitter, too, and people were making fun of me.

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:21.820
 But then somebody was like, it's probably McAfee.

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:25.820
 And sure enough, like, the Mac -- I had McAfee on it because they installed it on Windows.

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:29.820
 Like, McAfee will default your search to Yahoo from whatever.

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:30.820
 It's hilarious.

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:31.820
 It's hilarious.

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:34.820
 That is one of the funniest things I've ever heard in my life.

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:35.820
 It's insane.

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:36.820
 I was like, I know.

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:39.820
 I solved this problem for my parents when I was like 12.

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:42.820
 Like, I know this isn't -- I didn't do this, you know?

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:44.820
 Yeah.

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:45.820
 Yeah.

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:46.820
 Yeah.

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:47.820
 Yeah.

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:48.820
 That was the main thing that viruses would do.

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:51.820
 They would just add it to a bar and change your search engine, basically.

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:52.820
 Yeah.

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:53.820
 It's funny.

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:57.220
 I feel like the whole ecosystem is just full of, like, extremely convoluted and, like, cursed

00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:00.820
 business models where it's like, okay, we're going to build anti-virus software.

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:03.820
 But we're not actually going to make any money off the anti-virus software.

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:06.820
 It's just going to change the people's search engine and Yahoo is going to pay us.

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:11.820
 It's just, like, these crazy systems that are just, yeah, just, I don't know.

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:12.820
 Full of grifters.

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:13.820
 Yeah.

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:14.820
 It's just a total mess.

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:21.820
 But I mean, I still -- I mean, all my development start out in Windows, Visual Studio, Not Code,

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:26.820
 the OG, of course, a big, heavy, heavy, big boy.

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:27.820
 Okay.

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:31.820
 Downloaded through MSDN, your MSDN subscription that I did by it ever.

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:33.820
 My dad had, like, the binder full of MSDN.

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:34.820
 Oh, yeah.

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:37.820
 If you buy, like, the enterprise thing, they give you all the CDs with all the things.

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:38.820
 Oh, that's so cool.

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:40.820
 It was, like, every piece of software they've ever made.

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:43.820
 You get if the, like, top tier, that was so cool.

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:46.820
 And I never used any of it, but it was so cool.

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:51.820
 It was always, like, here, here's a copy of, like, Windows and Windows, like, Enterprise

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:52.820
 and Windows Enterprise.

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:54.820
 It's just, like, what are the differences between these things?

00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:59.820
 And it was all physical media, so it was, like, a version behind, and you couldn't really

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:00.820
 update it.

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:01.820
 Yeah.

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:06.820
 Imagine if we had to ship, like, software today on, like, a CD-ROM.

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:08.820
 Like, you burned it to a CD, like --

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:09.820
 That's tough.

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:12.820
 Imagine the timelines and, like, the stress that we're like --

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:13.820
 Yeah.

00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:14.820
 It's crazy.

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:15.820
 It's video games.

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:17.820
 We're like that for -- until recently, probably.

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:18.820
 By the last ones to shift over.

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:19.820
 Until Steam.

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:20.820
 Yeah.

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:21.820
 You got to actually not ship bugs.

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:22.820
 The web is pretty great.

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:23.820
 We can ship all kinds of bugs.

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:24.820
 It's an amazing platform.

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:25.820
 So many bugs.

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:26.820
 Yeah.

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:27.820
 Somebody --

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:28.820
 Fix the bug out there for the next day.

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:29.820
 Just fix the bug today.

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:30.820
 Just changing your search to Yahoo.

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:31.820
 That's just part of the process.

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:35.820
 You ship it, and then the only way to know there's a bug is when I use a report.

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:36.820
 That's how the --

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:37.820
 Yeah.

00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:38.820
 That's how the --

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:39.820
 Yeah.

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:40.820
 Let's just break things, bro.

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:41.820
 Yeah.

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:43.820
 What is your -- what is your setup right now?

00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:44.820
 Like, what is your development setup?

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:45.820
 I was going to ask the thing.

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:49.820
 I want to know, like -- because I see all -- you've got videos covering all the different tools

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:52.820
 that I wish I used, like, and -- and Zelda J and all these things.

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:53.820
 Yeah.

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:54.820
 What do you use personally?

00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:56.820
 Like, your code editor, your text editor.

00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:57.820
 So --

00:27:57.820 --> 00:27:58.820
 This is the laptop.

00:27:58.820 --> 00:27:59.820
 It's a framework, like --

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:00.820
 Nice.

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:01.820
 The 13-inch one.

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:02.820
 13.

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:03.820
 Super nice.

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:04.820
 These are lovely.

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:05.820
 I love these.

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:06.820
 This is a sponsored episode.

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:07.820
 Yeah.

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:08.820
 Nice.

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:09.820
 Welcome to the framework.

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:10.820
 It's hilarious.

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:11.820
 It's hilarious.

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:12.820
 Here's the thing.

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:18.820
 You can use framework with Nix, Adam, and then, as it says, to a reliable server on Reliable

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:19.820
 Site.

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:20.820
 Yeah.

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:21.820
 There you go.

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:24.820
 Now, I used that.

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:29.420
 I was using Arch for a long time, and I still miss some of it.

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:35.460
 But when I did a partial upgrade, which just somehow seems to happen, and I broke my machine,

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:37.940
 I was like, "You know what, let me just go back to basics."

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:40.180
 So, right now, I'm running Ubuntu with --

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:42.740
 Wait, my question is, how often do you do the upgrades?

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:49.220
 Because I have had a calendar item in my calendar forever now, like, again, over 10 years as

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:51.340
 Adam likes to point out.

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:54.700
 It's funny because we've been doing this for at least two years, so now it's like 12

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:55.700
 years, really.

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:56.860
 Oh, man.

00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:59.700
 That says Arch Update Fridays.

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:00.700
 Every Friday.

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:01.700
 Update my arch.

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:02.700
 I like that.

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:03.700
 So, you run Arch?

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:04.700
 Yeah.

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:08.780
 So, maybe I'm just like a bad arch user, but for me, I was like, "Oh, you know, there's

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:12.220
 this new thing in GNOME 47."

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:16.220
 I was like, "Oh, let me just like update that, and I'll try it."

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:17.220
 And I just updated --

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:18.220
 I see.

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:19.220
 I see.

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:20.220
 I just updated GNOME.

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:21.220
 And I was like, "All right, cool.

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:22.220
 That's interesting."

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:23.220
 So, like, whatever.

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:24.220
 Sometime later, I turned off the computer.

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:25.220
 I turned it back on.

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:30.820
 Just got a blank screen of like, "You fucked up, you need to fuck it up, you need to fuck

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:31.820
 up."

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:35.940
 So, that was the second time doing it, I did it once live on stream, which led to me making

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:44.340
 a video, which was like, interesting content, on using BTRFS file system, or as I like to

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:49.540
 call it, "Butterfs," because it has like, good snapshotting ability, you know?

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:57.420
 And so, I did all that stuff, and it all amounted to nothing, because like, it still broke my

00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:58.740
 computer.

00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:04.940
 So, then I just kind of -- I was like, "Yeah, I'm just going to install Ubuntu and just

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:05.940
 move on in my life."

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:06.940
 Actually, no.

00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:07.940
 Here's what happened.

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:09.860
 I broke my computer, and I was like, "You know what?

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:15.020
 I've been thinking about Nix, and there's a lot of people that say Nix will solve all

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:16.780
 my problems, you know?

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:19.180
 And my kids will finally like me."

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:23.220
 And so, I was like, "All right, let me look into Nix."

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:26.140
 And then so, I thought, you know, I give myself like, "Oh, six hours or so, just the

00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:27.140
 day.

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:29.140
 Let me play around with it."

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:30.140
 And I got nowhere.

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:35.980
 And I got so frustrated that I installed Ubuntu, and that's just where I'm at now.

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:40.300
 But it's always -- I have like an existential crisis every six months, so I'm going to change

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:41.300
 that for sure.

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:42.300
 Yeah.

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:44.780
 I don't know what yet, but I like Arch.

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:45.780
 I miss the AUR.

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:46.780
 That's the thing I miss the most.

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:51.740
 I was just going to say, for me, the main reason I like Linux is package management.

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:52.740
 It's great.

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:53.740
 I love it.

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:55.940
 And then Arch has like -- It's the first class citizen.

00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:56.940
 Yeah.

00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:01.340
 Everything you could -- like any random thing I need to install, it's just in there for

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:02.340
 some reason.

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:03.340
 I don't know why.

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:04.940
 Some guy maintains a package for it.

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:05.940
 It's awesome.

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:07.460
 It's such a great setup.

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:09.580
 That's the main reason I use Arch.

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:10.580
 Probably the only reason.

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:11.580
 Yeah.

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:16.220
 So, Ubuntu, what do you use for, like, geez, T-Mux or Zella J or --

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:17.220
 Oh, yeah.

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:18.220
 So, yeah.

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:22.540
 Typically, it's NeoVim and T-Mux.

00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:23.540
 That's the whole start.

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:24.540
 No, no.

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:25.540
 Let's go start from this.

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:26.540
 Ghosty.

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:27.540
 Let's go.

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:28.540
 Love ghosty.

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:29.540
 So cool.

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:31.300
 Mitchell's making a hell of a terminal emulator.

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:32.300
 It's really good.

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:33.300
 Yeah.

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:34.300
 Max, you need to get in the beta.

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:35.300
 You really do.

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:38.300
 I just -- I just implemented my own terminal emulator again this weekend.

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:40.260
 It's extremely slow.

00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:43.340
 Wait, you're building your own?

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:45.420
 For the second time.

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:46.420
 Wait, what?

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:49.800
 Because the SST multiplexer is a terminal emulator.

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:50.960
 I'll use SST.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:51.960
 Oh, right, right, right.

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:52.960
 Yes.

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:53.960
 I do happen to use it.

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:57.980
 No, no, sorry, no, sorry, I got confused.

00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:02.660
 We said terminals, and there's one called ST that is the Sockless terminal.

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:03.660
 And yes.

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:04.660
 Yeah.

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:05.660
 And so I -- yeah.

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:06.660
 So I got confused.

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:07.660
 SST, right.

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:08.660
 Yeah.

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:12.900
 So we have the need to show multiple commands in a single process.

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:16.420
 So we have to implement our own emulator so we can show it.

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:19.620
 And I'm doing a V2 of it right now.

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:22.140
 So yeah, it's very slow.

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:27.740
 It was good enough for us, but like I opened up NeoVin in it and it was like, I could feel

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:29.500
 the lag when I was hitting the keys.

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:34.020
 I'm like, I don't think I was going to open NeoVin here, but good to know.

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:35.900
 What goes into that?

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:36.900
 How do you start?

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:37.900
 Yeah.

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:41.380
 It's just -- I mean, I know how much you've looked into this stuff, but like, there's

00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:45.300
 just a set of codes that terminals understand.

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:49.380
 Codes like move the cursor to this position, change the color to this color, print this

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:50.380
 character.

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:55.620
 And you just have to like parse streams of that and then maintain, effectively, a buffer,

00:32:55.620 --> 00:33:00.300
 probably a memory usually of like a grid of cells, which is like the terminal.

00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:05.900
 And based on the command that comes in, you like do something to this grid in memory and

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:11.020
 you flush that out to the screen whenever -- whatever logic you want to use for that.

00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:16.100
 So it's just an effort in really studying all of the codes and like implementing them all

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:20.540
 exactly correctly, and then there's just a lot of them, and some of them are like -- there's

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:25.700
 like the core sets that is like kind of universal, then goes to implements a lot of the newer

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:29.660
 cooler things like supporting images and stuff like that.

00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:35.020
 And there's just been like iterations over the years from supporting like, from 256 color

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:42.740
 to like the full RGB -- sorry, RGB gamut, so yeah, just interpreting these ANSI codes.

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:46.700
 It's actually very -- in terms of the actual like loop, it's very simple.

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.340
 It's just interpreting the thing, moving the cursor, doing the thing.

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:53.140
 It's just there's a lot of these codes and some of them are like a little weird.

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:57.940
 But it's actually a perfect thing to use LMs for it because you just ask them like, hey,

00:33:57.940 --> 00:33:58.940
 what does this code do?

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:02.680
 And like, you know, it's kind of obscure information, but it is out there and it kind of nicely

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:03.680
 summarize it for you.

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:04.680
 Not really interesting.

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:06.580
 But you're building -- I'm still so confused.

00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:12.940
 You're building an emulator like that you run instead of running like the terminal app

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:13.940
 on your Mac.

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:15.580
 So the user doesn't have to install one themselves, right?

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:16.580
 Yes.

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:17.580
 That's the issue.

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:21.500
 It was a -- it's like if everyone was using Teamux, then we would just open all the processes

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:25.460
 as Teamux, Windows, whatever, and then you can just look through them.

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:28.900
 But majority of people don't, and we still need to give them the ability to look through

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:29.900
 it.

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:33.220
 So it's kind of like having Teamux built into RCLI, like a studio Teamux.

00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:34.220
 God.

00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:35.220
 Okay.

00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:36.220
 I'll show you your Teamux.

00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:37.220
 Okay.

00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:38.220
 Shit, Mux.

00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:39.220
 Shit, Mux.

00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:40.700
 What -- so what's Zella J?

00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:44.900
 I keep saying it because I want somebody to tell me what it is.

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:50.900
 Zella J is a -- it's a terminal multiplexer, very similar to Teamux, but it's just way

00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:54.060
 easier to actually like teach it and understand it.

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:55.060
 Oh, it's Zella J.

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:56.060
 Zella J.

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:57.060
 Zella J.

00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:58.060
 Zella J.

00:34:58.060 --> 00:34:59.060
 Yeah.

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:00.060
 I can tell it J.

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:03.700
 And the video I made for it, I went to some -- you know, the -- how do you pronounce this

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:06.660
 like YouTube videos or whatever, and the thing was wrong.

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:07.660
 It said Zaliga.

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:10.140
 And I was like, "Huh, there's no one Zaliga today."

00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:12.460
 That's actually really good prank.

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:15.500
 You just produce a bunch of those videos and just always say it the wrong way.

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:16.500
 Yeah.

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:17.500
 Actually, because that's just --

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:18.500
 That was really good.

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:19.500
 That's so funny.

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:23.380
 But no, I think -- yeah, I think it's a -- someone could correct me if I'm wrong.

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:27.940
 I think it's an Arabic word for like tile or something, or like mosaic, like -- so you

00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:29.140
 can place tiles.

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:33.500
 But it's a -- it's like a terminal multiplexer just like Teamux.

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:38.260
 And it's just -- it just has really good same like defaults and the key combination sort

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:39.420
 of makes sense.

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:43.060
 And you actually have, if you open up Zellage on your computer -- I don't have it on this

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:48.580
 one otherwise, maybe I would -- but you have like a bar that shows you like push this button

00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:50.740
 and then you push that one and it goes into like pain mode.

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:54.820
 So you do control-p goes into pain mode, and then a new bar shows up and it says N would

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:56.260
 give you a new pain.

00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:58.780
 And then so like it's just a really good like almost modal --

00:35:58.780 --> 00:35:59.780
 Watch it through it.

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:00.780
 Yeah.

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:01.780
 It's a pretty straightforward thing.

00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:06.860
 It has -- it's like more modern than Teamux, so it has a lot of the quality of life improvements

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:11.060
 that you'd want from Teamux, like automatic, like session resurrection, you know, it's

00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:12.620
 not like a pipeline or something.

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:17.500
 It's just something you could type a key command and it'll open up a little like buffer window

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:21.860
 or, yeah, like a floating window that has the list of your last sessions, you could resurrect

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:22.860
 them from there.

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:23.860
 You know what I mean?

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:28.260
 So it's got a lot of good quality of life improvements, but yeah, no, it's a -- it's

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:29.260
 really nice.

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:32.740
 I don't use it like daily, is there -- what's the downside of it?

00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:33.740
 It is.

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:35.940
 So it depends on your use case.

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:39.780
 So for me, I'm so used to Teamux.

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:43.540
 Zellage is like -- it's almost modal, right?

00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:47.780
 You have to hit a key command to go into like pain mode and then N would give you a new

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:49.020
 pain, for example, right?

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:51.580
 But for Teamux, there's no real mode.

00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:53.020
 It's just like key combination.

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:54.020
 It's just like a --

00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:55.020
 Yeah, it's your leader key.

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:56.020
 Yeah.

00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:58.660
 It's leader and then a key will give you like a new thing, right?

00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:05.380
 So -- and then on top of that, I'm very much used to using Teamux with Neovim.

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:07.860
 And there's two plugins that go hand in hand.

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:13.460
 There's a VIM Teamux Navigator, which is like the Neovim piece of this.

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:16.300
 And then there's the Teamux navigation plugin.

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:20.900
 Those two together will basically say like, oh, I know that the pain you're trying to

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:23.300
 go to is a VIM pane.

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:25.220
 So I'm going to send the command that brings you into VIM.

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:29.380
 And then the VIM one will say, oh, you're trying to go to a Teamux pane right now.

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:31.060
 So I'm going to -- I'm going to push you to the Teamux pane.

00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:36.780
 So all of this together, what you can get is a nice setup where if you just hold control

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:41.340
 and your HJKL keys, it'll go up and down from Teamux to VIM, Teamux to VIM.

00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:42.340
 You don't have to do it.

00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:44.540
 You don't have to prepend it with control W.

00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:45.540
 Yes.

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:46.540
 L or --

00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:47.540
 I want this.

00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:48.540
 I want it.

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:49.540
 Yep.

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:50.540
 It's awesome.

00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:55.060
 And so I've been using that for about 10 years.

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:59.060
 Which is funny because actually it probably has been about 10 years, but that's the thing

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:00.060
 I use.

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:05.220
 And so that's why I use Teamux because that is my use case.

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:07.940
 Someone else is more comfortable with different key combinations or whatever.

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:11.780
 Zellage is way easier to learn, if that makes sense.

00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:12.780
 I feel the same way.

00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:18.100
 I just have like the muscle memory of Teamux is like so calcified at this point where I'm

00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:22.820
 like, even with those benefits, it's not like compelling enough for me to try to switch.

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:23.820
 Yeah.

00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:24.820
 Teamux is crazy.

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:25.820
 It's like the key combinations.

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:29.500
 I'm just like a year in to the Teamux thing.

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:32.960
 And it's not totally calcified, but I also learned bad.

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:33.960
 Somebody told me --

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:34.960
 I don't remember who told me to use --

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:37.460
 You got to go to the center for kids who could read good.

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:38.460
 You can't read good.

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:39.460
 I learned bad.

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:40.460
 I learned bad.

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:41.460
 I don't know.

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:47.260
 Somebody told me to use leader control A. And so my Teamux leader key is control A. And

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:49.140
 I've been told now that that's bad.

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:51.940
 That is not the default and I don't know what everyone else does.

00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:54.620
 That's because when I was trying to use your computer, I was hitting control A to

00:38:54.620 --> 00:39:00.320
 go to the beginning of a bash shell thing.

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:01.320
 And it just wasn't working.

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:02.320
 I was like, what is going on?

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:03.320
 I was trying to protect your identity.

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:04.320
 I didn't need access.

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:08.160
 I wasn't trying to jox that you were the one that made fun of me, but someone made fun

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:09.160
 of me.

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:10.160
 I didn't make fun of you.

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:12.820
 I was just upset that what I was doing wasn't working.

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:13.820
 I was just curious.

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:14.820
 Like I want to have the default.

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:16.620
 I want someone to be able to sit at my laptop.

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:17.620
 The default is stupid, right?

00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:21.060
 It's a control B, which I always found to be kind of weird.

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:22.060
 I hope he's terrible.

00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:23.060
 I set this thing.

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:24.060
 Yeah.

00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:25.060
 That makes sense.

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:28.660
 Mine's control S, which is something that I, again, set when I first ever used Tmux.

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:29.660
 Oh, it is.

00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:30.660
 Okay.

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:31.660
 Yeah.

00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:33.460
 I think that's, I think that's like an accepted like that's what a lot of people use.

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:34.460
 That's the defacto.

00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:35.460
 Okay.

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:37.900
 Control S because control S normally freezes the screen, right?

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:39.340
 I think that's what it normally does.

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:44.060
 It like freezes your terminal output, which I hate to do that because I almost always

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:45.060
 do by accident.

00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:46.060
 I forget hit on freeze it.

00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:47.060
 So yeah, it's good.

00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:48.060
 That's remapped.

00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:49.060
 Yeah.

00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:50.060
 No, I, yeah.

00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:51.780
 I've never, I don't think I've ever used control S for anything other than Tmux.

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:52.780
 So yeah.

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:58.620
 So control S would be, if I wanted to be at least in unity with this podcast, then control

00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:02.940
 S. I just, I'm getting ready to redo my knee of M. I got to redo all my stuff and I want

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:03.940
 to do it the right way.

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:04.940
 I want to learn the correct.

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:07.700
 When Adam says redo, he means he's going to clone my doc files.

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:08.700
 I'm going to clone.

00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:15.780
 Hey, next time you're in the bath with your Mac book, clone the doc files, just have a

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:20.120
 good little, you know, I'll just pull up some type crap videos in the bath and I'll just

00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:22.220
 learn how I want to set myself up.

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:23.220
 Does it make you uncomfortable.

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:25.180
 It happens to me naked while he's watching.

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:28.340
 I assume everyone's naked when they watch this.

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:33.280
 So it's a good percentage of people are, yeah, I'm naked when I record videos.

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:35.540
 I just, you know, say, yeah, I put clothes on me.

00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:36.540
 The clothes on.

00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:37.540
 Yeah.

00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:38.540
 Yeah.

00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:39.540
 You fix it in post production.

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:40.540
 Yeah.

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:41.540
 My editor hates me.

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:42.540
 Yeah.

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:43.540
 Okay.

00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:49.300
 So you got ghosty, you've got Tmux and you got any of him.

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:50.300
 That's your setup.

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:54.740
 And you, you typically do Ruby is that where your, yeah, no, my whole career has been Ruby

00:40:54.740 --> 00:41:01.380
 on Rails with, I've, I've followed the gamut of JavaScript frameworks that Ruby has adopted

00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:02.380
 or Rails rather.

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:07.940
 So I don't know if anyone remembers this, but, um, uh, a little thing called jQuery.

00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:08.940
 No, just kidding.

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:15.500
 Um, so Rails, uh, for a while, the, the framework that they liked or library, whatever was back

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:16.500
 bone JS.

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:17.500
 Yeah.

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:20.260
 I did some back bone stuff, which I thought was so, it was just like a nice little alley

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:25.500
 again, like pub sub kind of library was, it was nice for, I was Amber.

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:28.380
 And so I, I did a little bit of Amber for a couple of years.

00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:35.260
 And then, um, and then by necessity, I was actually a react and next JS developer for

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:39.260
 years, like a few years and I was really, actually, yeah, for a while, my career was

00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:43.340
 more front end than full stack or back end.

00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:48.020
 And I did, and I'm, uh, I like have my own thing, like my own, like my own business.

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:50.380
 I like, you know, having my own like stuff that I work on.

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:53.340
 So for a long time, I was a consultant, like freelance or whatever.

00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:54.340
 Same.

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:55.340
 And one of my clients.

00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:56.340
 Oh, nice.

00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:57.340
 Yeah.

00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:03.760
 So one of my clients, I did a, uh, an iOS app in Dart and Flutter, wow, which was kind

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:04.760
 of lovely.

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:09.340
 Actually, this is really nice to work with Dart feels like JavaScript with like good, good

00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:10.340
 types types.

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:11.340
 Yeah.

00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:15.620
 There's an alternative universe where like Dart actually stuck in the browser and like

00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:17.940
 pushed out JavaScript, but then happened.

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:18.940
 Yeah.

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:19.940
 I like, I like Dart a lot.

00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:20.940
 Flutter.

00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:21.940
 Yeah.

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:22.940
 Okay.

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:23.940
 It's the, the, the rails thing.

00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:26.940
 DHH, I've seen him like big fan of your stuff.

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:27.940
 Yeah.

00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:28.940
 Says it on Twitter.

00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:29.940
 Is that new?

00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:31.820
 Did you know DHH from before or was this?

00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:32.820
 No.

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:33.820
 Yeah.

00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:34.820
 No.

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:35.820
 We're old friends.

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:36.820
 You guys go way back.

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:37.820
 You drove in the race together.

00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:42.420
 That, that whole, that whole arc of this like YouTube thing that we've been doing is

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:47.260
 that was the most, that was the best part of this other than being on this podcast with

00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:48.260
 you guys.

00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:49.260
 Of course.

00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:52.100
 I would think, I would think like rails, if you're a rails developer, that he's like

00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:53.100
 your Jesus.

00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:54.100
 Yeah.

00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:55.100
 So, uh, yeah, he is, yeah.

00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:56.100
 He's my Jesus.

00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:57.100
 Uh, he knows a lot here.

00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:58.100
 Now.

00:42:58.100 --> 00:42:59.100
 Yeah.

00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:03.060
 Um, no, so, so it's, it's, it was amazing for me.

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:05.020
 I'll, I'll, I'll give you a little bit of insight.

00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:09.540
 So I graduated college with a computer engineering degree, which, um, kind of like

00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:12.340
 facts, probably I built, I built computers in high school and stuff.

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:13.340
 I liked the game.

00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:15.540
 And so I was like, I don't know what I want to do with my life.

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:17.020
 I didn't know I liked software.

00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:20.500
 So I was like, I just know I like computers, you know, and I hated school.

00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:24.060
 And I was like, whatever, I'll just do something with computers, maybe I'll be interesting.

00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:28.740
 Computer engineering was a bad choice because it was, uh, a mix of electrical engineering

00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:30.980
 and a little bit of computer science, right?

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:36.180
 So it was really heavy electrical engineering, which was not, not something I was very interested

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:37.180
 in.

00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:38.180
 Yeah.

00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:39.180
 Um, but somehow I graduated.

00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:40.260
 And I didn't know what I wanted to do.

00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:43.700
 I had a couple of like random jobs, like a QA guy and whatever.

00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:46.300
 Um, not to bash QA people.

00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:48.100
 Um, it just wasn't what I liked.

00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:49.100
 Stupid QA.

00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:50.100
 Yeah.

00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:51.100
 Stupid.

00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:52.100
 But that's a joke job.

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:53.100
 Um, yeah.

00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:54.100
 Yeah.

00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:59.660
 Working as a QA person, I worked as a company that did like kind of on site, QA, yeah, yeah.

00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:04.180
 I worked out one company on site where these people were making like stuff in rails and

00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:05.180
 I didn't know what this was.

00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:06.180
 I was like, Oh my God.

00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:07.180
 So cool.

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:10.820
 You can make like this thing look beautiful, but also you're like writing code to make

00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:11.820
 it happen.

00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:13.820
 Like I didn't understand like the web could do that.

00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:18.500
 And so, and so that's when I learned about Ruby on Rails never since then, then I saw

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:23.580
 like the how to make a blog and 15 minutes video that, um, that, you know, DHH did many

00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:28.940
 years ago about about 10 years ago, uh, like 15, but, um, he did that many years ago.

00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:33.060
 And so like I watched that religiously like over and over trying to understand like, what

00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:34.060
 is this database?

00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:35.060
 What's a model?

00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:36.060
 Like what's the schema?

00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:39.540
 Um, how does, how does this like, you know, all that stuff, temple files and eventually

00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:43.620
 I got into rails and like my career kind of started, like kind of a little bit later on.

00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:49.500
 It was, it was, it's amazing that so with that in mind, that context, um, me making videos

00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:55.140
 on neo-vim and zealage and like Linux, it was, it was crazy that all of a sudden DHH

00:44:55.140 --> 00:45:01.140
 like, uh, because I posted, I think the first time he reached out was, yeah, 50,000 subscribers.

00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:04.220
 Um, we're at a hundred, hundred, hundred eight now.

00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:12.340
 Yeah, at 50,000, I posted a song on Twitter and DHH said like, Hey, congratulations.

00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:13.340
 I love your work.

00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:14.740
 And I was like, DHH knows who I am.

00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:15.740
 Like that's amazing.

00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:20.380
 And then not so long after that, he DM'd me on Twitter and was like, Hey, by the way,

00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:21.380
 congratulations.

00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:22.380
 You're doing great stuff.

00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:27.080
 Um, we have this conference in Toronto coming up, uh, it's all full, but like maybe you

00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:30.460
 could do like a workshop or something on like zealage and this thing that you made videos

00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:31.460
 on.

00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:32.460
 I was like, really?

00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:33.460
 Yeah.

00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:38.620
 Like ever since then, like we got to go to, um, Toronto and do this workshop on zealage,

00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:42.740
 which was equally like, uh, extremely scary, but also very like rewarding.

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:48.180
 And that was when like, you know, this whole YouTube thing still kind of new to me.

00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:50.580
 It's only been like a year or so max.

00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:54.660
 And so that was when people like the first time someone like recognized me, you know,

00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:58.100
 and like people like kind of lined up saying being like wanting to like take pictures and

00:45:58.100 --> 00:45:59.100
 stuff.

00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:00.100
 Like this is freaking crazy.

00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:03.620
 Like, I didn't know anyone would ever like care about anything I'm doing.

00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:04.620
 Like this is so cool.

00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:07.080
 Like a huge age, like Carrie brought me out here.

00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:12.020
 And then after that, um, uh, while we were there, I was like, I'd love to make videos

00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:13.340
 on this rails eight stuff.

00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:14.340
 Like all this stuff's really cool.

00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:16.700
 You're doing like, I love this version of the framework, whatever.

00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:20.940
 And, uh, and, uh, he was like, Oh, you're a rails developer.

00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:28.740
 And so, and so, um, and so, um, and so now I did, I did a whole series on rails eight.

00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:30.940
 That's on their YouTube channel, which is like just so nice.

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:35.340
 So yeah, this whole circle of like this, this thing has just been super cool.

00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:36.340
 Really, really cool.

00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:37.340
 That's a wild coincidence.

00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:40.500
 Cause he just kind of got into all this stuff and you happen to be like the YouTuber doing

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:41.500
 all this stuff this year.

00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:46.900
 I mean, is there other people that do the kind of like terminal based YouTube content?

00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:47.900
 I just, I think so.

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:53.820
 I think there's a lot, um, actually someone who I, um, model a lot of like the video style

00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:58.820
 after this guy, uh, network Chuck, uh, I don't know if you guys are part of them.

00:46:58.820 --> 00:46:59.820
 Oh, yeah.

00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:00.820
 He's super well known.

00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:03.140
 Like that's, I try and emulate a lot of what he does cause I just love his videos.

00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:07.220
 He's, he's so good and everything is so high quality, like everything he does.

00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:11.580
 And so he does stuff like on team ox and like things like that, um, that, uh, he's done

00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:12.580
 a really good job with too.

00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:15.220
 But yeah, I don't know if there's people who focus specifically on this.

00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:20.700
 I know like it was funny when I first made a couple of YouTube, uh, videos on like Neil

00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:25.360
 van or whatever, um, I would post them on Reddit and Reddit is like the meanest place

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:26.360
 in the world.

00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:29.420
 So like I posted one on Reddit and people were like, this is garbage.

00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:31.140
 Like, why, why are you even doing this?

00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:35.020
 Like everyone just go to this video or whatever and it was like one of TJ's videos on like

00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:36.020
 Neil van.

00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:40.140
 We're like, it's always like, I'm never, I'm never going to be like that.

00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:44.380
 That's, that's tough and then so, um, I don't know.

00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:47.940
 Yeah, I'm not sure other than like, uh, you know, I know TJ makes a lot of great new

00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:51.340
 YouTube and videos, he did a whole series recently on all that stuff.

00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:52.780
 So, um, yeah, I don't know.

00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:53.780
 I'm not sure.

00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:54.780
 I think there's a lot of people.

00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:55.780
 Yeah.

00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:57.780
 I guess TJ and probably both do some like T mux, these stuff.

00:47:57.780 --> 00:47:59.660
 I know bash has done some T mux stuff.

00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:00.660
 Oh, yeah.

00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:01.660
 Bash.

00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:02.660
 Yep.

00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:03.660
 That's funny.

00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:05.540
 Like I guess your whole channel feels, and I guess now you're doing real stuff, but it

00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:10.620
 feels like if you're just into this stuff and I feel like we all are, you're just, if you

00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:14.540
 just like want to mess around with your dot file sometimes, it's like your channel is the

00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:19.340
 perfect land there and learn something new that you could implement in your console.

00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:20.340
 Yeah.

00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:22.300
 It's a whole, yeah, it's a whole like kind of vibe of the channel is like, Oh, this stuff's

00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:23.300
 cool.

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:24.300
 I find it super interesting.

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:26.340
 Like check out this cool thing that I figured out.

00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:27.340
 Yeah.

00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:28.340
 Here you go.

00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:32.500
 Like the, you know, hyper land and I three and like, um, just all that stuff.

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:35.380
 So yeah, no, I've always found it interesting my own entire life.

00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:42.380
 So well, you know, my adult life career, 10 years, whatever, 10 years.

00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:45.380
 Yeah.

00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:46.380
 We're getting pretty old.

00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:47.380
 It's going to be 20.

00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:48.380
 I've got a lot of gray in this beard.

00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:49.380
 We're going to have starts in 20 years.

00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:52.740
 I'm turning, I'm turning 40 in February, February, I'm 38.

00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:53.940
 So I'm right behind you.

00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:54.940
 Yep.

00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:55.940
 Yep.

00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:56.940
 What about you, Dax?

00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:57.940
 I am 33.

00:48:57.940 --> 00:48:58.940
 I'm 32.

00:48:58.940 --> 00:48:59.940
 I'm 32.

00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:00.940
 I'm turning 33.

00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:01.940
 Are you serious right now?

00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:02.940
 I thought you were like 35.

00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:03.940
 I can't believe you're actually only 32.

00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:04.940
 But you're not, you're not sure either.

00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:13.140
 Yeah, I have no idea right now.

00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:16.700
 I'll just say you look great.

00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:21.540
 Like you look, you look younger than, you know, me and like, and of course I guess you

00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:22.540
 look appropriate.

00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:23.860
 Look at that hashtag GBT.

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:29.300
 If I was born it, what, yeah, what year were you born?

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:30.780
 This is not hard.

00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:34.900
 Is it December, 2024?

00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:35.900
 I am 32.

00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:36.900
 I'm 32.

00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:37.900
 I'm 32.

00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:38.900
 I'm 32.

00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:39.900
 I'm 32.

00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:40.900
 Okay.

00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:41.900
 Yeah.

00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:42.900
 I'm 33.

00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:43.900
 Wow.

00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:44.900
 You're like 32.

00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:45.900
 How did I think you were like 35?

00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:46.900
 It's not that far.

00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:47.900
 It's like it's a three year window.

00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:48.900
 Yeah.

00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:49.900
 But it's like able to rent a car.

00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:50.900
 It's crazy.

00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:52.900
 So I just passed the part where there's stuff to look forward to.

00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:53.900
 Now it's just, you know.

00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:54.900
 Hmm.

00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:55.900
 Yeah.

00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:56.900
 All that stuff is done.

00:49:56.900 --> 00:49:57.900
 Yeah.

00:49:57.900 --> 00:49:58.900
 32.

00:49:58.900 --> 00:49:59.900
 Yeah.

00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:00.900
 I feel like I'm almost 10 years older than you now.

00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:01.900
 I'm not.

00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:02.900
 But it feels like almost.

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:04.900
 Yeah.

00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:05.900
 Yeah.

00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:06.900
 Yeah.

00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:07.900
 Yeah.

00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:08.900
 Yeah.

00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:09.900
 Yeah.

00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:10.900
 Yeah.

00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:11.900
 Yeah.

00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:12.900
 Yeah.

00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:13.900
 Yeah.

00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:14.900
 Yeah.

00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:15.900
 Yeah.

00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:16.900
 Yeah.

00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:17.900
 Yeah.

00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:18.900
 Yeah.

00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:19.900
 Yeah.

00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:20.900
 Yeah.

00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:21.900
 Yeah.

00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:22.900
 Yeah.

00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:23.900
 Yeah.

00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:24.900
 Yeah.

00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:25.900
 Yeah.

00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:31.900
 You brought up network Chuck and I realized why his name is familiar to me is because he also has a coffee.

00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:32.900
 Brand.

00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:33.900
 Yes.

00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:34.900
 Oh that's a coffee.

00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:36.900
 It seems like you do too as well.

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:37.900
 I forgot.

00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:38.900
 Yeah.

00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:43.900
 No, that one kind of it's funny how like things kind of fall into your lap.

00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:50.900
 So one of our earliest like community members like someone on our discord and like someone who's like been a member of our.

00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:51.900
 We have a site.

00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:52.900
 Typecraft.

00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:53.900
 Yeah.

00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:54.900
 Don't worry about it.

00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:55.900
 It's fine.

00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:56.900
 It's a reliable.

00:50:56.900 --> 00:51:04.900
 But you know, one of our community members like one of the first people like, you know, paid and like was like a part of the thing, wanted to support us.

00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:07.900
 He just so happens to be like this awesome coffee roaster.

00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:11.900
 And like for a long time, he was like, I'd love to like make coffee for you guys.

00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:12.900
 Like, can we do this?

00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:15.900
 And like, so we were on, I don't know if you guys know, ghost CMS.

00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:17.900
 We were on ghosts for the first iteration of our website.

00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:19.900
 So it's like very limited with what you could do.

00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:23.900
 And so Robert, my business partner, I think you guys met in New York.

00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:29.900
 He, he did all this work to get us off of ghost onto like a new rails eight, like sort of things.

00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:30.900
 So it's like a custom site now.

00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:33.900
 So we can do all these different stripe integrations and all this stuff.

00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:37.900
 And so like the very first thing we did, we were like, all right, let's, let's do this coffee thing.

00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:44.900
 And so the first rollout is really just like, if you remember, you can add coffee as part of your subscription.

00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:46.900
 So you get like every month.

00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:47.900
 Oh, nice.

00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:48.900
 Yeah, it's a good price.

00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:49.900
 This guy makes amazing coffees.

00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:50.900
 He's really good.

00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:55.900
 So he's local there, like he's some may you knew he's in Kentucky or Kentucky.

00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:56.900
 Wow.

00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:57.900
 Interesting.

00:51:57.900 --> 00:51:58.900
 Yeah.

00:51:58.900 --> 00:51:59.900
 So not local.

00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:01.900
 But I mean, I could even give you guys his name maybe after this.

00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:03.900
 And I don't know if you guys want to use him too.

00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:05.900
 He's, he's really, he makes excellent coffee.

00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:06.900
 Yeah.

00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:08.900
 So, but you saw it through a website?

00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:10.900
 Like, how does that work?

00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:11.900
 Something coffee through a website.

00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:12.900
 Yeah.

00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:15.900
 I don't really understand that.

00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:21.900
 A lot of people want to do that.

00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:22.900
 Uh, yeah.

00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:23.900
 No, I don't know.

00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:27.900
 It's a weird, it was a weird choice on our ends, you know, like it wasn't, uh, you know, a website.

00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:29.900
 It's like, who does that anymore?

00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:34.900
 It's very, it's very like, it's very like 2018, right?

00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:42.900
 It's funny because we initially were like, okay, we'll do like the terminal thing for like a little bit and then like probably we'll eventually roll out a website.

00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:48.900
 And now it just became a thing where we're like, we, we, we, we, we like never want to do a website.

00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:52.900
 I should see how far we can go with just sticking to the terminal, making that a bit.

00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:53.900
 Yeah.

00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:54.900
 It's so cool.

00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:55.900
 Like, it's such an awesome thing, you guys.

00:52:55.900 --> 00:53:01.900
 I can't imagine, um, the, the, the stripe integration you had to build for that, though.

00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:02.900
 That must have been really difficult.

00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:04.900
 Do you want to talk about it, X?

00:53:04.900 --> 00:53:05.900
 It wasn't.

00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:06.900
 It wasn't.

00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:07.900
 Yeah.

00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:12.900
 Yeah.

00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:18.900
 Cause I mean, the way it works is, uh, you know, how Stripe gives you all those like front end libraries and JavaScript to just capture and everything happens in the browser and then with their server and there's a token at the end.

00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:20.900
 It's actually the exact same thing.

00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:24.900
 So they obviously don't make like the only wrap that in a JavaScript library.

00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:26.900
 So we can make those same calls directly as well.

00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:30.900
 Oh, so we still just get back a token credit card goes straight to stripe.

00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:31.900
 We get back a token.

00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:33.900
 Then we like the same way that it's done on web.

00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:34.900
 That's so cool.

00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:37.900
 That's what I was thinking too.

00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:40.900
 Cause Stripe, you just use their JavaScript thing and it just, you don't worry about it.

00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:42.900
 But that's, if it's that easy, that's awesome.

00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:43.900
 It's the same flow.

00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:44.900
 Yeah.

00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:51.900
 Uh, I mean, we probably eventually will let like a browser pop open and connected that way if you want, but, uh, yeah, it works for now.

00:53:51.900 --> 00:54:01.900
 At some point, they might say like this is not kosher and they might force us to do the browser thing, but until then, um, we're okay.

00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:05.900
 It's super secure.

00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:09.900
 It's safe and reliable.

00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:10.900
 No, yeah.

00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:11.900
 No, you guys are all engineers.

00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:12.900
 You know, you're doing it.

00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:14.900
 It's just, uh, it's such a cool, that's such a cool thing though.

00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:15.900
 It's, it's really neat.

00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:16.900
 Yeah, it's been fun.

00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:18.900
 We're getting ready to roll out an API type craft.

00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:24.900
 It's going to, you can like buy coffee through our API and then put it in your apps or whatever.

00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:25.900
 Really?

00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:26.900
 Yeah.

00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:27.900
 That's awesome.

00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:32.900
 It's very, over, over engineers, not the right word, but it's like way too official.

00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:38.900
 There's like, yeah, personal access tokens and you can like create your own terminal app with a client ID and a secret.

00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:44.900
 And then, uh, you know, we have a, we have a, we have official SDKs even for Java.

00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:45.900
 Yeah.

00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:47.900
 And it's publishing to Maven.

00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:48.900
 Literally.

00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:49.900
 That's awesome.

00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:50.900
 No, that's, that's how you do it though.

00:54:50.900 --> 00:54:51.900
 That's so cool.

00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:52.900
 That's, that's really neat.

00:54:52.900 --> 00:55:00.900
 And that's really neat, instead of like having proper subscription functionality, where it's going to tell you to generate a personal access token and create a grand job for yourself.

00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:01.900
 That's so cool.

00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:02.900
 I love that.

00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:07.900
 That's, I mean, that's, that's hilarious, but I mean, it's kind of a cool setup or you have a calendar reminder.

00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:08.900
 Right?

00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:09.900
 Yes, there you go.

00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:10.900
 Yeah.

00:55:10.900 --> 00:55:11.900
 Upgrade Arch and order content.

00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:12.900
 Yeah.

00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:17.900
 I'm going to publish an arch package where whenever you install it just orders, it just orders another bag.

00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:18.900
 I'm going to be updated.

00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:19.900
 Just straight up now.

00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:22.900
 Where?

00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:24.900
 I know, I know we got off the arch conversation.

00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:28.900
 But I just have to say my story with arch, I almost used arch and I couldn't do it.

00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:29.900
 I, the bootloader.

00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:31.900
 You didn't almost used it.

00:55:31.900 --> 00:55:32.900
 Okay.

00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:34.900
 If you did install, you didn't almost.

00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:36.900
 I said almost.

00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:38.900
 I would have used it if I got you.

00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:40.900
 You only mean you almost used it once.

00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:41.900
 Like that's what you mean.

00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:42.900
 Yeah.

00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:43.900
 Almost used it one time.

00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:48.900
 But the bootloader step, I failed to install something about the bootloader and I was reading the docs.

00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:49.900
 They were so good.

00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:50.900
 It's good.

00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:53.900
 You probably went the grub route and set a system boot route.

00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:58.900
 I don't want to, I don't want to resurrect it and figure out what happened.

00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:00.900
 I just, I'm at peace.

00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:01.900
 I'm not an arch user.

00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:02.900
 Yeah.

00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:05.900
 Well, the, um, did you use the installer scripts, the arch install scripts?

00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:06.900
 I don't remember.

00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:07.900
 I think it was the manual.

00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:10.900
 I felt like it is difficult.

00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:11.900
 It is difficult.

00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:12.900
 Thank you.

00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:13.900
 I felt like if I'm going to do this.

00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:14.900
 It's not difficult.

00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:15.900
 It's not difficult.

00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:20.900
 I felt like it was like the earn your stripes.

00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:22.900
 Like you got to do it the hard way.

00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:24.900
 I think people look at it that way.

00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:25.900
 Yeah.

00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:27.900
 You learn a lot about how it works.

00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:28.900
 That's why I work doing once.

00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:29.900
 When it doesn't work.

00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:32.900
 And then you don't learn anything because you just never use arch.

00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:34.900
 Because you weren't meant to go.

00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:37.900
 Just you personally weren't meant to go.

00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:38.900
 That's it.

00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:42.900
 Listen, every other engineer at terminal uses Linux and you don't.

00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:45.900
 Am I the only Matt?

00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:46.900
 Oh, engineer, I see.

00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:48.900
 Even Liz uses Linux.

00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:49.900
 Yeah.

00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:50.900
 Even Liz uses Linux.

00:56:50.900 --> 00:56:51.900
 Nice.

00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:52.900
 Yeah.

00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:53.900
 Teambox and the oven.

00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:54.900
 Oh, man.

00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:56.900
 You're actually the most casual engineer.

00:56:56.900 --> 00:56:57.900
 I'm the front end engineer.

00:56:57.900 --> 00:56:59.900
 I'm the front end developer.

00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:00.900
 Leave me alone.

00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:01.900
 Yeah.

00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:04.900
 I drink soy lattes and I work on a Mac.

00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:05.900
 You're a front engineer.

00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:07.900
 That works on a go SSH front end.

00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:08.900
 And soy boy.

00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:10.900
 Oh, we're both soy boys.

00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:11.900
 Have a mention.

00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:12.900
 Oh, yeah.

00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:13.900
 That's right.

00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:14.900
 Plant based, right?

00:57:14.900 --> 00:57:15.900
 Mm hmm.

00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:16.900
 Thank you.

00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:17.900
 Now we're out.

00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:19.900
 What's the without voting backs on this part?

00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:20.900
 I don't know what I'm going for.

00:57:20.900 --> 00:57:21.900
 Out representing.

00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:23.900
 There are more plant eaters than meat eaters.

00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:24.900
 Yes.

00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:26.900
 But I eat so much meat that I make up for.

00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:28.900
 He makes up like three times a day.

00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:29.900
 You do.

00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:30.900
 You do.

00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:34.900
 Hey, well, hey, get to the 21st century, pal.

00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:35.900
 Yeah.

00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:40.900
 Well, it's funny because literally if you trace my ancestors, 100% vegetarian for like 3,000

00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:41.900
 years.

00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:42.900
 And then you.

00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:43.900
 And then there's me.

00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:44.900
 Three times a day.

00:57:44.900 --> 00:57:46.900
 You had to put an end to it.

00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:48.900
 You had to put an end to it.

00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:49.900
 Yeah.

00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:50.900
 No.

00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:51.900
 I'm going the other way.

00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:52.900
 I do it.

00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:54.900
 I mean, it's not really, it's not even like an ethical thing.

00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:56.900
 It's more like it's just straight up like healthier.

00:57:56.900 --> 00:57:58.900
 You know, it's just like, you know, that's why we started.

00:57:58.900 --> 00:57:59.900
 I mean, just for our health.

00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:00.900
 Yeah.

00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:01.900
 Next would debate that heavily.

00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:06.900
 I've had times where I'm on and off, you know, but like, there was, um, it's just

00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:12.900
 such a, you could, you could measure it because I, uh, I had a doctor's appointment where it,

00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:15.900
 like all my blood work was like, it was okay, but it was like all everything kind of high.

00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:17.900
 And they're like, Oh, we got to look out for this.

00:58:17.900 --> 00:58:18.900
 Got to look out for that.

00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:21.900
 And that's, you know, the period of my life was kind of like eating like shit.

00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:23.900
 And, um, that's like, you know, I'm going to turn this thing around.

00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:25.900
 I love, I love eating vegan.

00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:26.900
 I've done it before.

00:58:26.900 --> 00:58:28.900
 I'll just, I'll just go like more, you know, 100% on it.

00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:29.900
 And so I did that.

00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:34.900
 And like in three months, everything dropped so drastically that I was like way out of the,

00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:36.900
 you know, I don't know what you call it.

00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:37.900
 The risk zone.

00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:38.900
 Yeah, exactly.

00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:40.900
 So like it's a measurable effect.

00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:44.900
 At least for me, it's like, yeah, there's, there's no way that's not a healthy, you know,

00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:45.900
 lifestyle or way to eat.

00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:47.900
 So let's stick with it.

00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:48.900
 That's how I feel.

00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:49.900
 Yeah.

00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:50.900
 And I lost 40 pounds.

00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:53.900
 I'm just going to make sure that, uh, Adam dies before me.

00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:54.900
 And then I'll be right.

00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:57.900
 I'm convinced he's going to die before me.

00:58:57.900 --> 00:58:59.900
 Well, I'm 10 years older than you.

00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:01.900
 So probably he's got that.

00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:04.900
 Yeah, he's got that.

00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:06.900
 You're not 10 years older than me.

00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:07.900
 Brown did.

00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:08.900
 About 10 years older than me.

00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:09.900
 About 10 years.

00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:10.900
 We're down to five.

00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:11.900
 Me and you both.

00:59:11.900 --> 00:59:12.900
 Similar age.

00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:13.900
 Yeah.

00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:14.900
 We both use T mucks and Neovin.

00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:15.900
 Yeah.

00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:17.900
 We're both plant based and we both work for sports technology companies.

00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:18.900
 That's true.

00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:19.900
 That's kind of crazy.

00:59:19.900 --> 00:59:20.900
 That's very true.

00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:21.900
 Yeah, it is pretty nice.

00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:22.900
 We're basically the same person.

00:59:22.900 --> 00:59:23.900
 And you're both tall.

00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:24.900
 We're both tall.

00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:25.900
 Both handsome.

00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:26.900
 Both handsome and white.

00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:29.900
 Man, I have a mustache.

00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:30.900
 I just also have a beard.

00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:32.900
 Yeah, we have a mustache with extra.

00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:33.900
 Yeah, I got all the other stuff.

00:59:33.900 --> 00:59:35.900
 You know, I can't grow a beard.

00:59:35.900 --> 00:59:36.900
 Really?

00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:39.900
 Like you know that mustache and you can't grow the rest of it.

00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:40.900
 The mustache is great.

00:59:40.900 --> 00:59:41.900
 I could grow a hell of a goatee.

00:59:41.900 --> 00:59:42.900
 This stuff doesn't show up.

00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:43.900
 Really?

00:59:43.900 --> 00:59:47.900
 Have you like really tried like going for months without?

00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:48.900
 Yeah, it's gross.

00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:49.900
 Okay.

00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:50.900
 It's gross.

00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:53.900
 Because for me, I used to have right here bald spots on each side.

00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:54.900
 Like a perfect circle.

00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:56.900
 And I was like, this sucks.

00:59:56.900 --> 00:59:57.900
 And then one day it just went away.

00:59:57.900 --> 01:00:00.900
 I just like stuck through it.

01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:01.900
 I looked horrible for like a couple of weeks.

01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:03.900
 And then if my body figured it out.

01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:07.900
 Yeah, that was probably you're still like, I feel like you're still, you were young enough.

01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:10.900
 Then probably, I mean, I don't know how long ago was this for you?

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:11.900
 Yeah, it was like, right.

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:13.900
 I was like 20 probably.

01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:14.900
 Yeah.

01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:15.900
 Okay.

01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:16.900
 I'm almost 40.

01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:17.900
 I don't think it's going to change any time soon for me.

01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:19.900
 Yeah, probably not.

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:22.900
 Also, we have something else in common.

01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:24.900
 You still do jujitsu?

01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:25.900
 Yeah.

01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:26.900
 I did jujitsu.

01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:27.900
 You did jujitsu?

01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:28.900
 For three months.

01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:29.900
 You did jujitsu?

01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:30.900
 For three months.

01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:32.900
 Like you just started?

01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:34.900
 No, it was last year.

01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:36.900
 I did it for a while.

01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:37.900
 You got hurt.

01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:38.900
 I bruised ribs.

01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:39.900
 Yeah.

01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:40.900
 Like just.

01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:41.900
 Yeah.

01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:42.900
 It's awesome.

01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:43.900
 I love jujitsu.

01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:51.900
 I pulled like a rib muscle or something and maybe kind of like dislodged a rib in a competition.

01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:52.900
 That was tough.

01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:53.900
 The rib stuff.

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:54.900
 Not fun.

01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:55.900
 Not fun at all.

01:00:55.900 --> 01:00:56.900
 Yeah.

01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:57.900
 Turns out you breathe all day.

01:00:57.900 --> 01:00:58.900
 Yeah.

01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:00.900
 So it's not fun when it hurts to breathe.

01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:01.900
 Yeah.

01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:02.900
 It's a lot.

01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:03.900
 But jujitsu too.

01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:04.900
 Wow.

01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:05.900
 This is amazing.

01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:06.900
 That's crazy.

01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:07.900
 Both have kids.

01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:08.900
 I'm going to have time.

01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:09.900
 I get kind of tired in the podcast sometimes to be honest.

01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:10.900
 Yeah.

01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:11.900
 I'm going to have to have just take my play stacks.

01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:12.900
 If that's cool.

01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:13.900
 I wouldn't even notice.

01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:14.900
 You probably wouldn't.

01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:15.900
 I don't think anybody would.

01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:16.900
 Oh, you have kids.

01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:17.900
 We didn't talk about your family.

01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:19.900
 You have like, how many kids do you have?

01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:20.900
 We have twins.

01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:21.900
 We have twins.

01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:22.900
 They're five years old.

01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:23.900
 Boy and girl twins.

01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:24.900
 Wow.

01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:27.900
 And actually we're expecting our third kid in April.

01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:28.900
 Oh, wow.

01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:30.900
 So we're pregnant right now.

01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:31.900
 Busy times.

01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:32.900
 Yep.

01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:33.900
 Hell yeah.

01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:34.900
 It's a lot.

01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:35.900
 So five years apart.

01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:36.900
 That's like my kids.

01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:39.900
 I have a nine year old, almost 10 and a five year old.

01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:43.900
 I'll spare you the how that's going.

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:45.900
 It's not going great.

01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:48.900
 They don't play well together with that age gap.

01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:52.900
 But you have you have a different situation because you have twins at the five years.

01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:54.900
 So they'll probably it'll work out.

01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:55.900
 Yeah.

01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:56.900
 And it's boy and girl.

01:01:56.900 --> 01:02:00.900
 And I think like our daughter is very, very girly and our son's very, very boyish.

01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:02.900
 And they don't play well together at all.

01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:04.900
 Either they're very, they butt heads all the time.

01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:05.900
 Yeah.

01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:09.900
 But the two of them, I think like collectively think that they're such big kids because this

01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:10.900
 new baby's coming.

01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:11.900
 They're going to be like a little baby.

01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:13.900
 So I'm hoping that they're like, you know, more of.

01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:14.900
 They'll be helpful.

01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:15.900
 Yeah.

01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:16.900
 I'll be more helpful.

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:17.900
 That's what I was like.

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:18.900
 Yeah.

01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:19.900
 My brother's 10 years younger than me.

01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:22.900
 It was just like a baby.

01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:23.900
 Exactly.

01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:26.900
 I want to know how many times we've said 10 years on this podcast episode.

01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:30.900
 We've just drilled that like into the ground and that you weren't even joking.

01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:32.900
 We start using the word decade decade.

01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:33.900
 I'm going to grab a toss.

01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:34.900
 A decade.

01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:35.900
 Yeah.

01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:36.900
 Wow.

01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:38.900
 So you two are basically the same person.

01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:39.900
 Basically.

01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:41.900
 How does it feel to not be very unique or special at all?

01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:45.900
 I've done this by myself for many years.

01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:50.900
 About 10 years.

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:53.900
 It's been a wonderful life sentence.

01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:55.900
 I've never been to the Ozark.

01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:56.900
 So there's that.

01:02:56.900 --> 01:02:57.900
 You've been to these coasts.

01:02:57.900 --> 01:02:58.900
 I've never been to.

01:02:58.900 --> 01:02:59.900
 There's no reason to go.

01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:00.900
 There's no reason to go.

01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:01.900
 There's really not.

01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:02.900
 Why are you?

01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:04.900
 So were you born around the world?

01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:05.900
 Yeah.

01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:06.900
 You said your family's from there.

01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:07.900
 Yeah.

01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:10.900
 I have always lived in like a 60 mile radius.

01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:12.900
 So Dax isn't wrong on that, but I have traveled some.

01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:14.900
 He's never seen the ocean.

01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:16.900
 He's never seen the ocean.

01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:18.900
 Well, they have a big lake there.

01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:19.900
 You don't need to see the ocean.

01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:20.900
 Yeah.

01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:21.900
 There's lots of lakes.

01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:22.900
 Caves.

01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:24.900
 You have seen the ocean though.

01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:26.900
 I've seen the ocean.

01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:28.900
 But that was a gulf.

01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:29.900
 That was a gulf.

01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:30.900
 That was a gulf.

01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:31.900
 Oh, that doesn't count.

01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:32.900
 Yeah.

01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:36.900
 That's just where old companies make spills and gulfs.

01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:38.900
 Nothing special about those.

01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:40.900
 Have you been to an ocean ocean?

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:42.900
 I guess you've been to.

01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:44.900
 It's just in New York.

01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:46.900
 But yeah, I've been to the east coast.

01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:47.900
 I've been to Southern California.

01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:48.900
 I had lived in Southern California.

01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:50.900
 But have you been to the ocean when you were there?

01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:51.900
 Okay.

01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:52.900
 You're right.

01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:53.900
 You did live.

01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:54.900
 Yes.

01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:55.900
 We spent time.

01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:56.900
 We've lived in Playa de Re on the ocean.

01:03:56.900 --> 01:03:57.900
 For like.

01:03:57.900 --> 01:03:58.900
 Playa means ocean.

01:03:58.900 --> 01:03:59.900
 Okay.

01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:00.900
 It means.

01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:01.900
 How's it?

01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:02.900
 I didn't know that actually.

01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:03.900
 The whole time you live there.

01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:04.900
 You're just like.

01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:05.900
 I had no idea.

01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:06.900
 Playa.

01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:07.900
 Okay.

01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:08.900
 Playa de Re's.

01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:09.900
 Yeah.

01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:10.900
 I don't know.

01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:11.900
 Is that a Spanish word?

01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:13.900
 Spanish for a whale's vagina.

01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:15.900
 I had to make the joke.

01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:16.900
 I don't know.

01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:17.900
 It was just right there.

01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:21.900
 Adam's never met someone that spoke Spanish before.

01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:23.900
 He's never heard Spanish before.

01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:25.900
 You're just making stuff up now.

01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:26.900
 We had.

01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:28.900
 I'm making stuff up from the beginning of this episode.

01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:29.900
 It's like really true.

01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:31.900
 From the beginning of this podcast, really.

01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:33.900
 You're going to say I have friends that are.

01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:34.900
 Friends that are.

01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:35.900
 What else?

01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:37.900
 Casey's just friend speaks fluent Spanish.

01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:38.900
 Her parents are from Mexico.

01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:41.900
 And she lived with us twice.

01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:42.900
 So there you go.

01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:43.900
 I know more Spanish than you.

01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:44.900
 Probably.

01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:45.900
 And what did she do when she lived with you?

01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:46.900
 What are you talking about?

01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:47.900
 What do you mean?

01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:48.900
 She lived her life.

01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:49.900
 Okay.

01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:50.900
 What are you talking about?

01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:52.900
 She wasn't our like our maid.

01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:53.900
 Okay.

01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:54.900
 Okay.

01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:56.900
 Actually, the second time we did play her.

01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:57.900
 Oh, yes.

01:04:57.900 --> 01:04:58.900
 Oh my God.

01:04:58.900 --> 01:04:59.900
 Yes.

01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:00.900
 That's awesome.

01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:01.900
 That's so fucking good.

01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:02.900
 I can't believe how.

01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:03.900
 It's funny.

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:08.900
 Because like it's what I'm suggesting is actually not true.

01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:11.900
 But like the way you told all that.

01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:13.900
 She lived with us for a while.

01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:15.900
 She happened to clean the kitchen a lot.

01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:16.900
 And it was much more.

01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:17.900
 It felt bad.

01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:20.900
 I might've been in prison between the.

01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:23.900
 You're talking about what I do with my home lab.

01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:24.900
 The illegal home lab.

01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:26.900
 And the illegal lab in the Ozarks.

01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:33.900
 You probably have the most legal illegal lab in the Ozarks.

01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:34.900
 It's totally true.

01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:35.900
 That's very true.

01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:36.900
 That's a lot of labs.

01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:37.900
 That's right.

01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:39.900
 Not the legal kind.

01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:43.900
 You guys ever hear explosions just like from the woods.

01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:44.900
 No, but true story.

01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:48.900
 My dad was in law enforcement like growing up for like 35 years.

01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:50.900
 He was a military state high patrolman.

01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:55.900
 And he has definitely run up on some like they've.

01:05:55.900 --> 01:05:56.900
 Yeah.

01:05:56.900 --> 01:05:57.900
 Sound that flabs.

01:05:57.900 --> 01:05:58.900
 Not that exploded.

01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:00.900
 Not that dramatic.

01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:05.900
 But then also I remember stories of like them finding giant stockpiles in marijuana.

01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:09.900
 And like they dispose of them and they just light this like giant bonfire.

01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:10.900
 And I'm like, how is that?

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:11.900
 And they got super high.

01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:13.900
 They're all getting super high.

01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:14.900
 Yeah.

01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:16.900
 They're all getting super high.

01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:21.900
 Yeah.

01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:22.900
 That's just kind of like a movie.

01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:24.900
 It's all the work of the job.

01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:25.900
 Exactly.

01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:29.900
 So it's Ozarks.

01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:32.900
 It's a bunch of people making meth and then Adam.

01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:33.900
 That's basically what's in my head.

01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:37.900
 I'm just like whenever I picture Adam, it's just like woods.

01:06:37.900 --> 01:06:40.900
 I think mountains.

01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:47.900
 Yeah.

01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:52.900
 It's like all these companies are like, huh, we've never shipped to this location before.

01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:53.900
 Yeah.

01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:54.900
 Yeah.

01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:56.900
 I'm sure it's lovely out there.

01:06:56.900 --> 01:06:57.900
 I've never been.

01:06:57.900 --> 01:06:58.900
 It's really not.

01:06:58.900 --> 01:06:59.900
 But yeah.

01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:01.900
 It's kind of you to say.

01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:04.900
 No, I'm sure the nature of the nature must be nice.

01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:05.900
 No, yeah.

01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:09.900
 There's a lot of like, if you enjoy the outdoors, I think a lot of people enjoy the Ozarks.

01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:11.900
 Which Adam does not, by the way.

01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:12.900
 I don't.

01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:13.900
 Yeah.

01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:14.900
 I kind of hate the outdoors.

01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:16.900
 That's the problem with the Ozarks.

01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:17.900
 Holy shit.

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:18.900
 That's awesome.

01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:22.900
 If you outdoors, you're a software engineer and you're in the Ozarks.

01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:23.900
 And I live in the Ozarks.

01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:24.900
 Yeah.

01:07:24.900 --> 01:07:25.900
 It's kind of a weird dichotomy.

01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:30.900
 Adam referred to himself as an endorsement, which I think is just so funny.

01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:31.900
 That's me too.

01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:33.900
 I mean, I'm totally an endorsement as well.

01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:34.900
 I think most of us are, right?

01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:36.900
 There's a weird endorsement.

01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:37.900
 Yeah.

01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:41.900
 What's the, uh, it was coding horror for a long time.

01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:43.900
 His bio said, uh, indoor enthusiast.

01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:44.900
 Oh, nice.

01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:45.900
 Yeah.

01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:46.900
 Oh, yeah.

01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:47.900
 Yeah.

01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:48.900
 I'm in a dark room right now.

01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:50.900
 Like does the most indoor you can possibly get?

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:51.900
 Just in blackness.

01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:53.900
 I can buy an indie supplement.

01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:55.900
 Like, you know, I stopped.

01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:57.900
 I stopped after I moved to Miami.

01:07:57.900 --> 01:07:58.900
 Stop taking vitamin D supplements.

01:07:58.900 --> 01:07:59.900
 Yeah, I bet you did.

01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:00.900
 You're outside.

01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:01.900
 Okay.

01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:02.900
 And your boxers get in the summer.

01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:03.900
 Yeah.

01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:04.900
 I'm in my boxers right now.

01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:05.900
 You can't tell.

01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:06.900
 I know you're in your boxers.

01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:07.900
 We're in New York.

01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:10.900
 There was like 10 of us in that apartment and you walked out at like 9 a.m.

01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:11.900
 every day in your boxers.

01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:12.900
 Oh my God.

01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:13.900
 That was awesome.

01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:14.900
 Oh, guys.

01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:17.900
 Wait, what happened with the, uh, the Twitch stream on that thing?

01:08:17.900 --> 01:08:20.900
 I was watching what, uh, it was after the show.

01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:21.900
 The next day.

01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:22.900
 Neil Vincomff or whatever.

01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:23.900
 Oh, Neil Vincomff.

01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:24.900
 Yeah.

01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:25.900
 Were you guys there for that?

01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:26.900
 Yeah.

01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:30.900
 I, I, I started to take a shower and then prime knocked on knock on that door.

01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:32.900
 And he was like, everyone can hear the shower.

01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:37.900
 And I was in the chat.

01:08:37.900 --> 01:08:41.900
 I was watching because I had a video that they're going to play on that.

01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:43.900
 I was later in the day, but like they had a problem.

01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:45.900
 Like the stream went down.

01:08:45.900 --> 01:08:46.900
 Oh, really?

01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:48.900
 We left like an hour in.

01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:50.900
 Did they play your video or no?

01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:51.900
 Yeah.

01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:52.900
 Yeah.

01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:53.900
 They did.

01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:54.900
 Okay.

01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:55.900
 Yeah.

01:08:55.900 --> 01:08:56.900
 We set it up and then we kind of left.

01:08:56.900 --> 01:08:58.900
 So, and prime and teach wouldn't know how to.

01:08:58.900 --> 01:09:02.900
 And I was with us, Adam, oh, primers with us.

01:09:02.900 --> 01:09:03.900
 Okay.

01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:04.900
 Teach wouldn't know how to fix it.

01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:05.900
 Sure.

01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:06.900
 He's an idiot.

01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:07.900
 Those guys are.

01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:08.900
 Oh, man.

01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:10.900
 I'm just playing random things now.

01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:11.900
 That was cool.

01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:12.900
 Yeah.

01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:14.900
 We guys did the, uh, the, the feud event.

01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:15.900
 That was awesome.

01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:16.900
 Yeah.

01:09:16.900 --> 01:09:17.900
 That was so cool.

01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:18.900
 That was a good time.

01:09:18.900 --> 01:09:19.900
 It was fun.

01:09:19.900 --> 01:09:20.900
 Yeah.

01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:24.900
 We're going to do it again in, uh, in Miami, which was going to be fun.

01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:25.900
 Are you really in Miami?

01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:26.900
 Yeah.

01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:27.900
 We're going to do it as part of a react Miami.

01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:29.900
 Like just the final thing for the conference.

01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:30.900
 Oh, that's so cool.

01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:32.900
 I, um, I'm so jealous.

01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:34.900
 Cause it's funny to tell my wife.

01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:35.900
 You're having your baby around then.

01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:36.900
 Exactly.

01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:37.900
 I can't go.

01:09:37.900 --> 01:09:39.900
 I was, this was the year I was like, oh, you know, I missed it last year.

01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:41.900
 I was very jealous of all these people I've never met in my life.

01:09:41.900 --> 01:09:43.900
 I don't know why I'm so jealous, but it just leaves like a good time.

01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:44.900
 Yeah.

01:09:44.900 --> 01:09:46.900
 And then so, yeah, this year I was like planning it.

01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:48.900
 I was like, oh, yeah, I'm going to go.

01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:49.900
 And then now we're, you know, no, we can't.

01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:52.900
 You didn't plan your pregnancy around react Miami.

01:09:52.900 --> 01:09:53.900
 Like a stupid bait.

01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:56.900
 I'm, I'm already making sacrifices.

01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:59.900
 This kid's already ruining my life.

01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:00.900
 Yeah.

01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:04.900
 We'll try to, we'll make sure nobody takes any photos that react Miami this year.

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:05.900
 Since you'll have FOMO.

01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:06.900
 No.

01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:07.900
 Yeah.

01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:08.900
 We'll keep everything off the internet.

01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:10.900
 I'm going to try to maximize a FOMO.

01:10:10.900 --> 01:10:11.900
 Yeah.

01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:12.900
 That's just not very kind.

01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:14.900
 No, that was, uh, the, uh, yeah.

01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:15.900
 No, the whole event was fun.

01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:16.900
 It was cool meeting you guys.

01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:17.900
 Yeah.

01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:18.900
 It was a good time.

01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:19.900
 Yeah.

01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:20.900
 Glad you came.

01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:21.900
 That was a good time.

01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:22.900
 Well, you were right there.

01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:24.900
 I mean, it's like, I can walk to the train that will go to New York in an hour.

01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:26.900
 So it wasn't that hard.

01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:27.900
 It was nice.

01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:28.900
 Wait, you walk for an hour to get on the train.

01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:29.900
 The train.

01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:30.900
 The train's for an hour.

01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:31.900
 That is the dedication.

01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:32.900
 Oh, the train is for now.

01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:33.900
 Yeah.

01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:35.900
 I don't know how public transportation works.

01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:37.900
 We got to walk places.

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:38.900
 All right.

01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:41.900
 Well, uh, it's been so good to have you on typecraft.

01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:42.900
 It's fun.

01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:43.900
 I'm going to love that.

01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:44.900
 Hang it out.

01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:45.900
 We both got to meet you in New York.

01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:47.900
 Now we get to hang out on the podcast.

01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:50.900
 And now we all have to get work done before the holidays because are you guys?

01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:52.900
 Is everybody taking off all next week?

01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:54.900
 The way Christmas happened this year.

01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:55.900
 It's like Wednesday.

01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:56.900
 It's Christmas next week.

01:10:56.900 --> 01:10:57.900
 Oh my God.

01:10:57.900 --> 01:10:59.900
 You are such a what are you?

01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:03.900
 You are the Grinch or the Grinch.

01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:07.900
 It's like every Christmas was next week.

01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:09.900
 You suddenly make me the Grinch.

01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:11.900
 Did you and Liz celebrate anything?

01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:13.900
 Did you just like work all day?

01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:14.900
 You just always work.

01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:15.900
 We just work all day.

01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:20.900
 They celebrate hitting their KPIs and milestones.

01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:22.900
 So, we have a family.

01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:23.900
 Okay, ours.

01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:24.900
 Yeah.

01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:25.900
 We do use Slack as a family.

01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:26.900
 Who has a squeaky chair by the way?

01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:27.900
 I'm hearing it.

01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:28.900
 Is that back?

01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:29.900
 Me.

01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:30.900
 It's me right there.

01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:31.900
 I have the same problem.

01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:32.900
 It ruined so many shots.

01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:33.900
 So, the squeaky ass chair.

01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:36.900
 I really never noticed it till you pointed it out this moment.

01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:37.900
 Oh, really?

01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:38.900
 Thank you for that.

01:11:38.900 --> 01:11:39.900
 You're welcome.

01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:41.900
 I just don't pay this in detail, I guess.

01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:43.900
 That's going to bother you now every waking moment of your life.

01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:44.900
 Liz's family is just so structured.

01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:47.900
 Like there's always stuff that's set up for us to do for each holiday.

01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:49.900
 So, we just don't have to think about it.

01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:50.900
 So, we're just going to go.

01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:52.900
 I think our parents' house and the whole family is going to be there.

01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:53.900
 Nice.

01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:54.900
 Yeah, it's next week.

01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:55.900
 Turns out, Christmas next week.

01:11:55.900 --> 01:11:58.900
 Do you have any big traditions, either you guys?

01:11:58.900 --> 01:11:59.900
 Traditions.

01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:00.900
 So, I mean, we do the normal stuff.

01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:01.900
 We put up a tree.

01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:02.900
 Yeah.

01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:07.900
 I'm trying to think anything special we do that's like, I don't think so.

01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:10.900
 I mean, a tree, I mean a tree and like all the normal stuff.

01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:11.900
 Yeah.

01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:12.900
 It's nice.

01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:13.900
 I mean, it's a nice Christmas morning.

01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:14.900
 But yeah, nothing special.

01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:15.900
 For us.

01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:16.900
 Go ahead.

01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:17.900
 No one cares.

01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:22.900
 Nobody cares about my thing.

01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:27.900
 Our whole family goes to my in-laws, like the whole family.

01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:29.900
 My wife is one of seven.

01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:33.900
 And all of her siblings, all their significant others.

01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:38.900
 And our kids and all their kids all converge on one house.

01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:40.900
 And we stay over Christmas Eve.

01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:42.900
 And so Santa goes to that house that day.

01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:46.900
 And so, like, it's just a whole room full of presents for all the kids.

01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:48.900
 It's a little chaotic, but fun.

01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:49.900
 Okay, Dax.

01:12:49.900 --> 01:12:50.900
 You can say your thing.

01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:51.900
 No, no, I was going to say that.

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:54.900
 Oh, I was going to remind me of something that me and Liz always talk about.

01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:57.900
 So you're, well, you say you're in-laws, your wife's family.

01:12:57.900 --> 01:12:58.900
 Yep.

01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:03.900
 So they have achieved something important, which is they have become the central hub for the

01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:06.900
 family, despite new people entering the family.

01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:10.900
 And me and Liz always talk about how we need to make sure we maneuver ourselves that way.

01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:14.900
 So we are the place everyone goes to.

01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:17.900
 As they get older, they have their own family.

01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:20.900
 So that's impressive for them.

01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:25.900
 Seven kids and they were able to retain control over the holidays.

01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:26.900
 That's crazy.

01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:31.900
 They have this big old house that they've had forever, about 10 years now.

01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:33.900
 That's interesting.

01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:36.900
 Am I making the joke old now?

01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:37.900
 Is the joke old now?

01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:39.900
 It was all, like, 10 times ago.

01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:40.900
 It was actually so-

01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:45.900
 Oh, well done, I was just, like, in confusion.

01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:50.900
 No, it's because they have this house with, like, eight bedrooms or something crazy.

01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:51.900
 It's a lot.

01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:52.900
 Yeah, so they have the space.

01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:56.900
 But yeah, does everyone live around you in Miami, like, in that area?

01:13:56.900 --> 01:13:57.900
 It's all Liz's family.

01:13:57.900 --> 01:14:02.900
 So if you are someone that is born in Miami, you very likely don't leave.

01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:06.900
 So most families here are, like, still very tight because it's, like, the extended family

01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:08.900
 lives all within four or five minutes of each other.

01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:11.900
 And basically her uncle, right now, it's the same situation.

01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:13.900
 He just got the biggest house.

01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:18.900
 So he has a kind of facto control over every holiday and everyone goes there.

01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:20.900
 But at some point, it's going to need to transition.

01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:22.900
 And I'm really vying for that spot.

01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:23.900
 Yeah.

01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:26.900
 And it's going to be, because I'm going to be, like, I was going to call it a usurper,

01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:28.900
 because I'm not from the original family.

01:14:28.900 --> 01:14:30.900
 I'm actually someone new.

01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:32.900
 And if I take over, that would be a big deal.

01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:33.900
 But again, I think I have a good shot.

01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:36.900
 Like, I think I'm the one that wants it the most.

01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:41.900
 I see you have been pulling the strings.

01:14:41.900 --> 01:14:42.900
 Yeah.

01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:43.900
 Love it.

01:14:43.900 --> 01:14:44.900
 But, you know, I have to get a big house.

01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:46.900
 My house currently is not big enough for that.

01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:49.900
 It looks super nice, though, from what I saw from the React Miami stuff.

01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:50.900
 Yeah.

01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:51.900
 It's a fun house, for sure.

01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:53.900
 For, like, house parties and stuff.

01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:54.900
 It's a good setup.

01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:57.900
 I just need to know why people from Miami don't leave Miami.

01:14:57.900 --> 01:14:59.900
 Why is Miami special?

01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:02.900
 It's just like the line culture thing.

01:15:02.900 --> 01:15:09.900
 It's, families are really tight, and this idea of your kids going away, it's culturally

01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:13.900
 really difficult to do, because, like, everyone just gilts the shit out of you.

01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:17.900
 Like, it's just, it's like, not something that's normal, seeing as normal at all.

01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:18.900
 Yeah.

01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:20.900
 So Liz left and went to New York for a while, and that was, like, such a big deal.

01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:21.900
 But almost nobody does that.

01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:26.900
 And even when you do, the poll is always there, and you probably are going to end up, end

01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:27.900
 up coming back.

01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:28.900
 Oh, man.

01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:31.900
 I worry about my kids growing up and leaving the area.

01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:32.900
 Yeah.

01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:33.900
 That's why you have to live.

01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:34.900
 That's another thing.

01:15:34.900 --> 01:15:39.900
 Like, it's important to consider moving somewhere that your kids actually want to live in when

01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:40.900
 they become adults.

01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:43.900
 Nobody wants to live in the Ozarks, so I really need to figure that out.

01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:45.900
 I got, like, 10 years to figure that out.

01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:47.900
 It just starts sewing the seeds of guilt.

01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:49.900
 Like, if they leave, you know, it'll be terrible.

01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:50.900
 Yeah.

01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:51.900
 Yeah, shame them.

01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:53.900
 It's like, let's skim a complex.

01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:54.900
 Yeah.

01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:55.900
 Just learn from this family.

01:15:55.900 --> 01:15:56.900
 They're pretty good at it.

01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:57.900
 It's funny.

01:15:57.900 --> 01:15:58.900
 It's just, like, they don't.

01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:02.900
 It's a dynamic where, like, when you're here, it's not, they actually care.

01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:04.900
 It's just, like, they just need to know that you're nearby.

01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:07.900
 It's not even going to see you all the time or talk to your hangout with you at all.

01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:12.900
 It's just the fact that you had the goal to leave just becomes a focus point.

01:16:12.900 --> 01:16:15.900
 When you're back, like, no, but it's not your one's like, oh, we're so glad you're back.

01:16:15.900 --> 01:16:16.900
 I'm spending a lot of time with you over anything.

01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:17.900
 Yeah.

01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:18.900
 It can only be negative.

01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:19.900
 Thanks again for coming on, man.

01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:20.900
 Thanks for having me on.

01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:21.900
 This was fun.

01:16:21.900 --> 01:16:22.900
 I enjoyed it.

01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:23.900
 Yeah.

01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:24.900
 Do it again.

01:16:24.900 --> 01:16:25.900
 All right.

01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:25.900
 Cool.

01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:26.900
 See you guys.

01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:27.900
 Bye.

01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:29.900
