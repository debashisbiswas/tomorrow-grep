WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 Only fans what oh, yeah, I guess trash is another so I don't look at only fans. I don't even know that

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.080
 You have a profile I thought you post there

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.640
 I

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:40.360
 Casey has me on this whole like skincare routine. Oh, I think it's working. She's got me doing like moisturizer at night before bed in the morning

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.480
 There's like vitamin

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.560
 See K. Yeah vitamin K. I do like a chemical exfoliant twice a week and the next day

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.560
 I do vitamin K retinol something out. It's a whole lot of stuff. She claims

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:59.720
 I mean she does it on her face. She looks young so she claims it'll do a lot of things stop aging

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.160
 I'm just I literally never put anything on my face. I hate the feel of lotion on my skin

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.820
 So the fact that I'm doing anything is going to look different

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.880
 It bothers me a little bit when I look at the man. I feel so shiny

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.680
 moisturize yeah

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.400
 It looks healthy for sure. Oh, yeah, I think I'm healthier than I was

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.800
 It's just still feels very foreign because I literally did nothing before I wouldn't ever put lotion on my face

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.800
 I just don't like the feeling mmm-hmm

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.700
 What's worse sand or lotion for you? Oh sand by a lot. Oh

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.720
 Sand is my least favorite thing in the world

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.840
 And I love like family vacation. I just the beach is so hard for me. I'm just the entire time

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.800
 I'm thinking about where the sand is. It's in my pockets. It's in my pants. It's under my fingernails. It's everywhere

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.400
 Yeah, I'm just like I'm just so used to it now because we're just always at the beach, so

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.120
 It's just it's not that bad like you just you just take a shower and you're fine

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.320
 Yeah, by the end I start to get used to it and I'm fine with it. Okay, the first day though

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.540
 I'm thinking about like is it gonna make it into our bed? I'm glad we didn't get a car with like leather seats

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.600
 Or anything because with the Zuko and going to the beach and everything is just our cars like a

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.080
 It's like an outdoorsy car at this point. Yeah, we call ours

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.720
 We so we've got like a model X so it's pretty nice

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.720
 But we call it the minivan because it's just like constantly there's food on the floor like there's just with kids

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.640
 It's impossible to keep it clean. Yeah, finally just embrace that like feeling that this is not a nice car

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.820
 It may have been a nice car, but it's not it's just it's a minivan

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.960
 That's life now. Yeah. Yeah, I definitely went with the more rugged options and I'm glad for that

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.680
 Can you get my energy up and you my energy levels up so we can get some high energy

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.600
 shorts

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.000
 Yes

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.280
 And I took some caffeine. I'm not gonna lie

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.320
 You took some the way you described that stuff when you took some caffeine like did you take it in pill form?

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.040
 No, I've done that in the past. It's been ten years, but I used to take something called thermo lean and

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:02.240
 It was like just a caffeine pill basically, but it was marketed as like this work out like abs

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.800
 No, I think it was marketed more like a pre-workout. I mean you were amped. I don't know how much caffeine was in it

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.960
 But then they started making it they wouldn't make the normal kind they only made this like thermo lean and ferno

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.840
 And it literally made me turn red like a lobster. Like my skin got puffy and red

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.400
 I don't know what they put in that thing. It was probably so unhealthy

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.360
 But you did you felt it you were ready to go. You know the devil every time you took yeah

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.520
 Take a look it up. I'm sure it's still a thing

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:37.180
 Thermo lean what's your five-hour energy? That's another thing. I've never tried

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.600
 I have never understood that just sounds like such a toxic thing to put into my body

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:48.480
 Like I see it and people like must be buying it. It's all over this grocery store. Like at the checkout. I have no idea

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.600
 It sounds horrible. Well, it's a kind of an incredible thing because it's not that old of a company and

00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:01.000
 Somehow it is literally in the front of like every convenience store ever. Yeah, how did that guy do it?

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.560
 I think it's I think it's like I someone mentioned a story before I think it's like kind of a random dude aren't we all and

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.920
 He somehow got this in literally every single store. He's super rich

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.440
 And people must be buying it because otherwise why would people why would they continue to keep it there?

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.600
 And then what's in it like what in it?

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.760
 It's just like a shot of something that gives me energy for five hours is super sus to me

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:30.880
 Why is that so sketchy sounding five hour energy and it's it's so funny. It's so precise. It's like it's just for five hours

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:37.080
 Yeah, maybe that's part of the problem for me is like anything they can be that sure of in the marketing

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.720
 I don't know. It just sounds like five hour energy ingredients much just be a caffeine drink

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.600
 Oh, it's just the same stuff that's in energy drinks towering is it just like more concentrated?

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:54.480
 I guess so it's a shot of it. Here's the thing. I uh, I love how some energy drinks taste like monster

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:59.840
 I think it's so good. I love the taste of red bull. I always did in college. I would drink red bull

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.200
 Yeah, like I don't care about the energy part. I just love the taste

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.680
 They're probably so bad for you though. Aren't they like your heart or something? I I mean, I don't ever drink them

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.320
 It's only so I have a rule where if I'm doing a super long road trip, which happens like

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.800
 Once or twice a year then I'll like get one of those like my little treat

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.000
 But outside of that now I never drink it because it just seems like poison

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.200
 So I had to drive from like south florida back to the Ozarks when we moved back home

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:33.280
 and it was like 22 hours or something from Naples and I I remember like

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.520
 Just driving through the night

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.920
 Coffee drinks like the cold coffee drinks from convenience stores and just pushing through

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.680
 Yeah, you kind of like something like that like a big event like a big drive or something

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.600
 You just kind of like make exceptions like screw your body. Well, you drove through the night

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:54.080
 Yeah, just you I think I slept like two hours out of that 24 hour period. That's really crazy

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.480
 Well, so I flew my family back but I drove a u-haul and pulled our car

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.480
 If we if we hadn't had a car like we actually sold our car before we moved down there

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.960
 And we just rode bikes for like the first three months. We were just like no car family

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.240
 Uh, but then we bought a car down there and if we didn't have that

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.440
 We probably would have I would have just flown and had some a move our stuff

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.040
 But I get in the car back and all that just drove a u-haul

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.720
 So I've done the long drive a lot like I've done it from New York to Miami a bunch

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.240
 Uh, and I've always had this issue. I'm sure a lot of people have it

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:31.760
 The road just hypnotizes me and I like start to fall asleep at the wheel and it has like nothing to do with me being tired

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:37.440
 Yeah, no after a certain amount of time. It's just so brain numbingly boring that

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.240
 I mean I try to listen to books and stuff, but there's no amount of books that can keep you occupied

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.600
 Uh before the drive. Yeah, the road just kind of drives you crazy

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:54.080
 I there's nothing worse in the world to me than being sleepy and at the wheel like you you want to sleep so badly

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.640
 And it's just like you will die. Yeah, I can remember having in high school

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.280
 I had a girlfriend that lived like 45 minutes away. Like everything in the Ozarks is like a long drive

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.240
 What's that? There you did

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.240
 Okay, you go to a different school

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.280
 So I just tweeted she did go to a different school

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.840
 Uh, so she went to some Mountain View and I went to Will Springs. Anyway, uh, who would make that up?

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.720
 Why would I make that up? I just I tweeted something earlier

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.200
 Says something about my wife said and somebody's like subtle flex about having a wife. Is that a flex?

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.880
 like

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.120
 How many people in the world have significant others?

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.340
 I'm not trying to like literally everyone eventually

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:33.680
 Yeah, right like this is not me trying to be impressive

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.200
 Do you ever think about that how like no matter like everyone eventually

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:42.720
 Mostly everyone just eventually gets married or like find someone. It's like it's kind of amazing

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.000
 I'm not how terrible you are like you can probably find someone that I'll marry you

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.400
 It's a good point. I guess some people don't I mean that's like a fear of like ending up alone, right?

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:58.000
 Because I never really understood that until I think like adulthood you really think about what would it be like

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.240
 I'm sorry if this is like

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.120
 I don't know. This might really hurt people that are in this situation

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:07.840
 Just like to grow old and realize if you didn't have kids and you don't have a significant other

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:12.960
 Like there's nobody like once your parents and that generation dies. There's nobody like looking out for you

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:13.840
 You know what I mean?

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.480
 Yeah, it is weird. It's kind of dark in it. I know

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.840
 Anyway, I interrupted you're probably nicer story. Oh, yeah

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.640
 Let's get back to the the easy one

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.040
 Much easier listening

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:30.160
 I had a girlfriend. She's like 45 minutes away and I would go and like hang out with her

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.000
 In mountain view or where a burst tree. This is so specific

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.480
 What about any literal tree is that what you're describing? Oh, it's called versus the town

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:45.440
 Sorry, so we would go like I would hang out at her house and I drive back home really late at night

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:49.200
 And I can remember falling asleep so many times on that drive at like 1130 at night

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:54.720
 And I just was pretty sure like I had a 50 chance in high school of dying on that road

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.120
 driving back for my girlfriend's house

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.600
 There's a pre-toxic relationship if you kill

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:05.120
 She made you almost kill yourself every time. Yeah, basically her fault

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.680
 Uh, yeah, there's definitely in times where I'm like

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.440
 Oh

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:14.160
 The last 10 seconds my eyes were closed and I have no idea what happened

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.280
 When you come to and it's like how long was I out?

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.000
 Oh, it's so I hate that so much

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 I mean the autopilot stuff now is great because my car even my car has uh

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:29.440
 Again on the highway can pretty much drive itself. Yeah, like saying the lane slow down if someone merging from me all that

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:35.120
 So that probably makes it like a hundred times less dangerous. There's yours. Okay. So your car

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:41.280
 It's probably not market. It is autopilot. No, it's just like lane assist and cruise control, right?

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.320
 Yeah, which is really something like that

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:48.880
 And that every car has that right does your car make you like touch the wheel every 15 seconds

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.040
 It's not as aggressive as a tesla one

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.360
 because like technically it does like make sure my hands on the wheel, but

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.080
 It's like

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.760
 Reasonable, it's not like I need to like jerk the wheel around every yeah

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:07.280
 Yeah, every person you're you're aware of how the tesla system works because I rented a tesla in Oregon

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.640
 I was another funny story

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:14.160
 So I rented a tesla in portland and we were driving to this really nice hike to like to do

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:18.160
 Uh, we got the car and I got a ticket three minutes later

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.200
 because

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.200
 portland has these giant highways like like they they seem like uh

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:29.680
 Like I don't know what type of thing they were called freeways when they're like or like interstate type things

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:33.040
 Yeah, I'm used to like being able to go like really fast on those

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:38.800
 But it turns out they're treated like a local highway and the speed limit is like 50 something miles an hour and I was going like 80 something

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:44.400
 And as I say this I'm remembering I actually forgot to pay that ticket and it's been two years

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:49.520
 So I guess I can't go back. Are you like wanted in the state of Oregon? I guess so

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.600
 Yeah, wow

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.600
 on the drive back

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.880
 I'm by the way, I'm terrified of like self-driving cars like I

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.840
 Yeah, like just I can't like my brain is is not there

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:04.240
 Uh, but I was trying a little bit with my like really diligently

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:09.440
 I was like trying it again because I was scared and I had my hand on the wheel and everything and tesla like didn't

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:15.680
 It like was too aggressive with what it was asking me to do and I thought I wasn't I didn't have my hand on the wheel

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:19.680
 And it like banned me from using autopilot for the rest of the trip. Yeah, it'll do that

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.360
 So I have I could go on all kinds of stories. I've driven tesla's for 10 years like we got our first in 2013

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.080
 And so we've seen the whole

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:32.320
 Self-driving stuff come along and then once I started marketing as autopilot

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:36.480
 It's funny to me that like people will be like, oh you drive a tesla. It's like drives itself

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:41.360
 Like no, actually it's a worse version of the probably better system you have in your car

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:44.880
 But it's marketed as autopilot and it makes me jerk the wheel over 15 seconds

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:48.560
 It's actually pretty bad and I think didn't they recall all the tesla

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:55.120
 Cars that have full self-driving beta or something. They've recalled like every tesla model x and model s or something

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.760
 I don't know the details, but

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.280
 Uh, yeah, it's not very good

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:04.240
 I I'm full believer that it'll get there and that it's going to be great when all of our cars drive themselves like

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.200
 Big fan of that idea. Hope we get there

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:14.400
 Uh, but the current version is just kind of like a marketing trick and it's a bad one. Yeah, I think me personally the

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:22.160
 I'm very comfortable with the highway self-driving where it's like following the lanes and even if for like decent-sized turns

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.960
 It'll be able to do it. Uh, and that's like

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:31.680
 80% of what I want self-driving for like 90% of what I want self-driving for so I feel like we already basically have

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.360
 It

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:37.120
 I don't really care about it navigating like my local streets for like the three minutes

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.520
 It takes me to go up the highway and back to my house

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:44.720
 Yeah, I can't imagine having the confidence in it because even on the highway or just like coming up to stoplights

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.840
 On like semi-highway like where it's pretty fast roads

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:51.520
 Uh, it's just like it doesn't stop at stoplight, but it'll stop at the car

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.680
 But it's just very aggressive like the way it breaks

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:58.240
 It's super aggressive and it's not the way I would drive so I can't imagine like

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:02.320
 Pedestrians around coming up to stoplights and in the middle of town like that would

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:07.440
 Freak me out. I hope we get there. Yeah, if I'm gonna die, it's gonna be my own fault. Yeah, exactly

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:21.120
 Why is everyone saying emo stream today? Is it because I'm here?

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.680
 I mean, I think they're referring to trash. Is that your vibe?

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:29.760
 I think so. I don't know what my vibe is. If I'm being honest, if I'm being honest, I don't know what my vibe is

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:33.680
 I mean part of your vibe is like, I mean the whole name is like I'm bad at stuff

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:39.440
 Just like don't mind me. That's part of it, right? But you're not bad at stuff. It's all a big scam

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:46.880
 Yeah, I don't think it was uh, I think it was just to lower expectations so people can't make fun of me

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:50.400
 Like so I said this example before you now. Have you ever seen eight mile?

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.760
 Uh, yes

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.520
 So at the very end of eight miles the m&m documentary or the movie

00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:01.360
 So at the very end he basically freestyles and disses himself the whole time to where the other guy just couldn't even say anything bad

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.960
 So it's like well, I always had a crash though. You can't come into my stream and tell me I suck

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:09.840
 I'm just like, all right, bro. We get it. We get it. So then it's like it just like pretty much like stops a lot of trolls

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:12.080
 So like when someone does a troll, I'm just like dude

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.520
 We just like well, just look at them. We're just like what are you doing and then just make it look stupid

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:21.520
 Did you always have that like did you start your online persona as trash or were you doing stuff before that?

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:24.160
 Yeah, it was great. COVID happened and I was like dude, I'm so bored

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.920
 I used to go to the office every day like I worked at like a startup and I was just like, you know

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:34.000
 It went from just like high-paced seeing people all the time constantly busy to like I'm sitting at home like

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:39.040
 Just sitting there and I was like dude, I need to like talk to somebody or something or I'm gonna like lose my because

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:43.840
 When you're in the remote environment like you can be on slack, but like no one's really talking on slack

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:47.600
 You don't really have like that interaction. I'm like a super I'm like a super social person

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:51.920
 I'm granted. I am the guy in the office has their headphones on and literally doesn't talk to anybody

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:56.240
 But like but like I absorb the vibe. But when I do want to talk, it's like I just don't work

00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:02.960
 Uh, so yeah, I just like did I need to go online and I think I saw like prime was like the first stream I ever saw and I was like

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.440
 Dude, people watch people program like this is stupid

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:10.880
 Who would like sit at their computer and like watch someone code? It was like it blew me away

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:15.840
 I didn't know what twitter was I always thought twitter was stupid. I was like who wants to just read sentences on their phone

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.960
 You know what I mean? It's like so like these two things like

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.600
 Slowly crept into my life

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:25.280
 Uh, but yeah, that was like pretty much how it all started like twitter was like later

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.160
 I started twitter like a year ago, but yet twitch was just like well

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:35.040
 I want to build stuff and I never finish it because I have no accountability. So maybe if I stream it like

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:39.680
 I'll finish it and it ended up. I just like kept knocking things out because when you start off

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.640
 No, it watches you or at least me because I didn't have like online presence

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:47.520
 So it's like I literally like my only viewer was like my phone that I put so I would at least have

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:52.400
 No, I'll talk to my wife and be like, hey, babe. Can you can you turn on my stream too?

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.400
 So I could have like two viewers

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:58.400
 So it was like that and I was just like well, no one to talk to me. So I was just crushing code

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:03.040
 And that's like how it was like three or so months and then like slowly people started like creeping in

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.040
 But yeah, it was wild

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:10.240
 It was wild now we're here. Yeah. Now. Now you like now you boomers are here now. It's just weird space

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.880
 Boomer. You're the oldest person to play with us

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:17.760
 What are you talking about? It's because you look like you're 12. Does it mean we don't know you're real age born in 2000

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.920
 Are you talking about?

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:23.040
 How old are you? Are you here?

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:28.320
 I'm not enough to be bored. I was gonna say yeah, I was pretty sure

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:34.320
 I think you said you were born in 85. I remember correctly. I was hoping you wouldn't say that during this

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:40.320
 Yeah, I'm a certified dad. It's fine. It's not a big deal

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.960
 Oh, look at that flexibility, man

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:46.800
 I just woke up well, I didn't just wake up and they're like I just started my day because I'm on the west coast

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:50.960
 So I'm just like getting into it. Just sat down. Yeah, what are you gonna be back on the east coast?

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:54.080
 So I was gonna move back to the east coast this fall

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:58.240
 But like my kids go into school and I was like, I don't want to move him in the middle of the school year

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.160
 Like they'll be like messed up, right?

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.880
 So I think we pushed it to the summer of next year

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:06.800
 So I'm gonna be paying an absurd amount of rent until next year

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:11.840
 Dude running california is like the worst thing but this what's even worse is like interest rates are so high

00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:16.480
 So I'm like looking at houses. So I was like, I just have to like put a fat down payment just so like

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:22.800
 We can always be fine answer. But dude, it's crazy. Yeah, we're in the weird situation with that too

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:28.320
 Like we have our apartment in New York, which we have like a 2-2 interest rate on which is fantastic

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:30.160
 You own it?

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.760
 Yeah

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:35.040
 So we got that like six years ago, but we moved in a little bit anymore

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.440
 We have a tenant would love to sell it

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:42.000
 But like then I lose my nice low mortgage to then like pick up

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:48.880
 Like a 7% mortgage now somewhere here. The prices here haven't like gone down to reflect the high interest rate

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:52.800
 It's just that nobody is buying or selling so there's like 10% amount of inventory

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:56.480
 They normally should be so how much are you making off the top of your of their rent?

00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:00.480
 We lose money. Oh, you're losing money on your New York place with your tenant?

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.360
 Yeah, New York City apartments don't really turn a profit

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:07.920
 You the only reason people own them is the long-term appreciation is like very

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:13.840
 Good historically, right so whatever money we lose theoretically we could make it back when we sell it

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:18.720
 I'm just hoping to break even on the whole thing because then it'll be like I didn't pay rent for the five years

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.040
 I lived there, but yeah, like if you add up

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:24.560
 The taxes and the maintenance for the building

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:28.000
 Uh, and we still haven't paid off the market so we're still paying a mortgage

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.280
 Like we lose money even with the tenant that we have had in there

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:34.480
 Wow, I thought you'd be making like a grand on top or something

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.080
 I guess it's that's another case

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:40.240
 We lose like a hundred bucks if we had paid the mortgage often. Yeah, we'd be making money, but you know

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.760
 Not not yet. So yeah, it's brutal

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:48.720
 It's brutal everywhere. What about you Adam? Like are you is your stuff paid off or no?

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.680
 I doubt it you live like in a kingdom. I don't know

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:59.760
 Now we've we've I mean we've got a low interest. It's like two and a half. I think we may have been when it was on the upswing

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.000
 What year was that uh two years ago?

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.840
 Yeah, so we've been in the sauce two years now, you know

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:09.840
 My friend bought a house like the month before the interest rates are going up

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:13.680
 And I was like and it was it was after like two years of looking for a house

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:17.760
 And he finally bought one and like perfect timing and I hate him forever

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:18.240
 Oh, yeah

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:25.520
 There's I have friends that I hate still because I know they moved like during it's like they sold right the peak before the housing crisis in

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:31.600
 '08 and they moved across the country and bought at these crazy low prices after it had crashed like east coast had crashed

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:37.680
 I don't know. It's like they made this huge windfall. Yeah. I should have kept my I should have kept my house when I moved mistake

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:44.400
 Big mistake also the people that bought at the beginning of the pandemic that was also really crazy. So in the neighborhood that I'm in

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:51.920
 Oh, here's something crazy. So I the house I'm in right now. I rent in Miami. It's a fantastic place. I'd love to literally buy this place

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:58.240
 The landlord bought it right at the beginning of the pandemic because you remember the beginning of the pandemic everyone was like

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:04.960
 Oh, no, like I don't know house prices are like everyone was panicking. So they were selling their houses for like very low

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:09.120
 He bought this place for 600k and I saw on the history

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:15.040
 Uh, he listed it for a year later literally one year later for 1.7 million dollars

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:17.520
 And I'm like you motherfucker

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:22.880
 No one bought it, but he like tried to sell it for like three times a price

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:29.680
 Insane. I have never once in my life bought something low and sold it high. I don't go the way around for me

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:35.680
 Oh, yeah, same timing just gonna work out for me. Yeah, I guess don't take financial advice from this stream. Yeah, don't

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:40.160
 Yeah

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:43.120
 Yeah, the only financial advice I have is just to make more money

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:47.440
 That's like just just make nothing's gonna help. Yeah, I was making more more more money

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:51.920
 I feel like I've been able to be pretty bad with money. Just making a lot of money in tech my whole career

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.760
 It's like kind of glosses overall the mistakes the timing problems and all that. Yeah. Yeah, that's only that helps

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:01.360
 I mean, that's what's nice when you have like a good income. It's like you kind of

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:06.640
 Don't have to pay as close attention to these kind of things, right? Yeah, but then when you kind of look back at it

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.080
 You're like man. I'm like a teenager with my money and just yeah

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:16.720
 Spending everything it's ridiculous. Oh my god in the Ozarks like it's a pretty I mean, it's not a super

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.880
 like

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:23.520
 High-income area. So I've had a lot of family and friends ask like could you help us with our finances?

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:24.960
 Like I don't know anything about it

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.960
 Like I've not just make money just make more money and most problems go away

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.800
 I think you're literally the only person I know that

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:35.600
 Like is associated with those arts at all like I didn't even know it was a real place

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:39.360
 I only knew about it because I'm not just a mountain. I really thought it was a mountain

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:43.520
 I just know it as a tv show. I still actually don't even know where it is

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:47.280
 It's just the middle of the country. It's like there's like a mountain

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:50.480
 It's like a hilly area in the middle of the country called the Ozarks

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:53.760
 I just know you post pictures of your surroundings and it looks grim

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.800
 I mean, it's like

00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:03.040
 I mean, it's it's pretty like from like a if you like like outdoorsy stuff

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:06.640
 There's a lot of like hiking and rivers and caves and stuff like that

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.720
 are you like in a neighborhood of like

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:14.000
 similar houses, are you just kind of like this like nice place in the middle of like

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.720
 Nothing and everyone's kind of looking at you like

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:23.440
 No, it's like uh, we've got an HOA and it's it's like a nicer neighborhood in the area

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:28.160
 Yeah, I just imagine like you go to the grocery store and you're like, oh, it's that rich guy coming in

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:33.600
 It's everyone. Look, it's the rich guy. It's the king. The king is here. How are you doing mr. Adam?

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.960
 We have your book ready for you today. Oh my god

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:41.280
 It's freaking what is it almond milk? What do you drink out of? We drink all of them

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:46.800
 Just not stuff that comes out of animals. So we drink soy. Are you vegan cashew? Yeah

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:52.320
 We've been vegan for like 10 years. It's so hard to talk about being vegan because of the perception

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:58.640
 Of like i'm vegan by the way. Well, it's like you use them. You're vegan. It's like you're like adding all these like trying to be

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:04.400
 Yeah, trying to be annoying like dax dax is he's got a big list crossfit. At least i'm not vegan

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.360
 Dax is definitely not being used as like posting steak photos

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:11.280
 I don't have a question about this. That's is it stephen stefan stefan

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:20.080
 Yeah, is he like is that his boat like every time you post a picture of like that dude

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.520
 Like they're doing like rich things. I'm just like who's the rich person in this like

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.080
 Dynamic

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:32.160
 The thing about miami is it's very very easy to become adjacent to a incredibly rich person

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:35.520
 so everyone here is always doing rich shit because

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:38.400
 there's like

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:43.680
 One out of every 20 people is like stupid rich and then they just throw parties with many other people

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:45.360
 so

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:50.240
 That's why miami's the spot to go if you want to look rich because someone will help you out

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:54.880
 Are you hanging out with other tech bros or they just like there's no tech bros here

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:57.520
 Is it just you? Yeah, it's not

00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:03.360
 Just me. Is it just you and uh and stuff? Yeah, just me and stuff on uh it's the two of us

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:08.320
 Uh, no, well, it's okay. What are rich people here like so there's a mix of like just very true

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.480
 traditional stuff like real estate

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:16.240
 Family has a bunch of real estate, whatever there's rich south americans that uh live

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:19.040
 Year half the year or whatever like their families here

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:25.200
 Uh, there are people rich from like the randomest stuff. I was telling adam. There's like a house that is like

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:31.600
 Crazy near us where the family just sells crackers and that's it. They just sell like the food

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:35.680
 What's the what's the comp? What's the brand? I don't remember. It's like it's like a very Cuban specific thing

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:41.280
 Uh, Liz's uncle is like like stupid rich and he owns just a bunch of health clinics here

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:44.160
 Uh, a lot of like small businesses that have scaled

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:49.440
 To like as big as a small businesses can scale. So there's just a lot of that

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:54.400
 Uh, so yeah, there's always just rich people but they're never and they're never really in tech

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:58.080
 Uh, some of that is starting to show up the only fans towers

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:01.280
 Those people aren't really rich, but they are serving

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:07.840
 Fans what oh, yeah, I guess trash didn't know this so I don't I don't I don't look at only fans. I don't even know what that is

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:12.720
 You have a profile. I thought you post there

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:18.160
 So mind me build like a crazy amount. It's not like other cities. They're just like, uh

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:24.000
 Bolognesque by housing like we built a good shit ton of housing. There's always like tons of cranes everywhere

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.120
 There's an area that we refer to as the only fans tower. So the bunch is like brand new

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:34.560
 Buildings and I swear like 40 percent of the people that live there are just 100

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:38.960
 Only fans people and you can tell you just walk by see people coming out. It is very obvious

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:42.160
 So they're referred to their house. They're definitely on only fans

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:48.880
 Liz is a Liz's sister has been trying to so she's been trying to find a roommate

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:52.960
 And in Miami like the whole living with roommates thing is not very common

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:58.320
 Because most who just live with their family like people don't leave Miami like you are born here

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.720
 You grow up here you stay with your parents

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:05.600
 Uh even while you're working maybe when you get maybe when you get married or get a boyfriend

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:08.800
 Then you like move out with your boyfriend or your husband and then you like live on your own

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:11.120
 So there's not a lot of people that have roommates

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:17.600
 And the other thing she was complaining about was like the only people I can find are like only fans people that just make their whole rent and like a day

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:21.440
 And yeah, so she found out really frustrating. Oh my god

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:24.560
 That is a thing here. That's a vibe. We need a

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:29.760
 Be the streamer house. I mean that's kind of like how it is in LA. It's like there's a lot of just content creator houses

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:35.040
 Right and just people are just I don't know. It's just the whole content creation thing is

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:40.320
 I hate him like it because obviously i'm like someone in it. It's like

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:43.680
 What if like I look in the mirror and i'm like who am I?

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:49.280
 Am I i'm not successful enough to be like one of those people, you know

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:57.280
 Yeah, how much does your wife know about like your online persona? Does she like look at your stuff? I think like i'm not like i'm not like famous or anything

00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.720
 But like when I first started streaming we lived in a smaller place in LA

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:05.280
 So I would literally be streaming and i'm in the living room. She's watching tv right there

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:10.160
 And like i'll just be saying stuff and she'll just like turn over like what are you talking about?

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:15.680
 Like I don't know and you can just see her watching tv behind me because the person wasn't big

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:20.720
 like and like i used to like um get drunk a lot before I had my second kid. I would just like

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:24.640
 Code and drink until I couldn't comprehend anything and then go to bed

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:31.280
 So what happened is I had like this dance redemption. I would just like dance someone would redeem dance and i'll just be drunk dancing in the living room

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.600
 And she's like she was just like

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.640
 Good her phone. She's like you're so embarrassing and i'm just like

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:44.000
 Interesting, it's interesting. I don't know. Did you ever think this would be your life?

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:50.480
 I'm trying i'm slowly like getting away from it slowly instead of it. I do like the twitter thing

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:53.120
 But I don't really like stream on wait getting away from

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:56.960
 I mean just like i'm just trying to like focus more on like

00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:00.560
 More important things Netflix I guess like all means like

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:06.160
 Now like i'm like excited about things i'm building which is it's been a while since i've been excited about building something

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:10.800
 So now i've been like kind of tunnel vision on that and all my free time mostly goes to that

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:14.320
 I mean i still like shit post on twitter like that's like my my bathroom thing

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:18.560
 But like now that like, you know, it's kind of like with like you guys and your products

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:23.680
 Right, it's like you have like successful products right and like you want to build things for it where

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:26.560
 Build things on top of it and that's kind of like

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:31.120
 I'm starting that era. I think for myself since it's like i'm pretty like stoked on it

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:35.840
 Um, so yeah, i've just been like heads down just doing my doing my thing

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:39.200
 You know what i mean like you guys are engineers like when you're like excited to build something, you know

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:44.640
 That feeling just like yeah zone out kind of ignore stuff and like now that like i've kind of

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:50.800
 Reignited that passion like i can i'm starting to like look at all these other things like oh man like it's not as fun

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:54.480
 Not as i don't i don't say it's not fun because i definitely want to keep doing it

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.680
 But it's like well i have something more important than i need to do at the moment

00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:04.240
 Yeah, i'll get you guys just kind of throwing around exactly i mean to be honest like it streaming on twitch was never like a priority

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:10.480
 Twitters never a priority, you know, we all love twitter, but it's like, you know, it's it's a time sink

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:16.160
 Because we just need to be distracted and you know, i don't know we just need to feel something i guess and it is fun

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:19.360
 Because it's like you're just like it's like you're just in a chat room with all your friends, right?

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:25.760
 So that's like that's what makes it like fun, you know, i know you guys can relate like, you know if we go through these ups and downs

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:28.880
 I'm not saying this is a down, but you go through time is where it's like well

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:32.000
 What am i doing?

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.600
 Yeah, what am i getting out of this i ask that question all the time. Yeah, it's like what am i actually doing so like i've been

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:42.480
 Slowly like not like time tracking my stuff on these apps but like being like, okay

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:48.240
 Put the phone down and let's do something else and then like be productive i guess yeah

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.400
 Yeah, so that's like kind of where i'm at now

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:54.560
 So and i'm not saying like now that i found like this new love of what i'm building

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:57.520
 I'm better than like all the people doing these other things that's not the case

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:03.360
 It's just that i will get back to it because it's just who i am like i love talking to people

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:06.560
 I love building communities are like can you share anything about what you're working on?

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:09.600
 I've seen you kind of tease some stuff on twitter what can you what can you tell us?

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:12.000
 Yeah, i mean we're just building like literally just like

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.120
 If you know me i'm like super hardcore about typescript and i love just like typescript in general

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:23.920
 So imagine just like a platform so there's like map pococks platform like told typescript for like learning and stuff

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:29.120
 But it's like a merge of like that the type challenge github repo

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:32.480
 Which if you have ever been into type challenges i was like super into that for a while

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:37.120
 We're bringing that so it's like merge that will leak code but then merge it with like the social aspects

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:41.360
 Of like social media so being able to like oh man, that's a cool solution

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:46.240
 Let me comment and share mine and blah blah blah but then like if anyone's ever used typescript playground

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:49.360
 It's really hard to like collaborate on those things

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:52.000
 So like you share you have like this huge link and blah blah blah

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:57.200
 So we have we're we basically built our own typescript playground

00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:02.400
 But like we're making it better like it's just a better typescript playground mix will leak code mixed with

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:06.880
 The educational aspects of like teachers like matt and like other platforms

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.720
 Yeah, yeah

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:14.560
 So yeah, i mean at the end of the day it's more it's more or less like leak code on steroids but specifically for typescript and specifically

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.720
 like

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:20.480
 Just to be able to like it's like it's a very niche group. It's for people that are just like

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:26.720
 Really into it. All right, like so you see like on like matt pococks there has he does like a he has like a target audience

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:32.880
 Right people that yep or like either super hardcore into it doing like rich generic stuff or people that just want to get better

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:38.560
 So it's like kind of like scratching both of those itches so you can imagine there's like a number of categories that you can

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:44.160
 Use for like challenges. So we have like beginner so like you just started and then all the way up expert

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:47.360
 But the cool part is we're gonna try to benchmark your typescript

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:51.440
 So the idea there is if you're a library maintaining your typescript slow we

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:56.000
 We want you to just come to our platform and copy and paste your typescript and we'll actually benchmark it for you

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.600
 Um, so like when you think about typescript now and you kind of like when you're kind of comparing your solutions

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:05.600
 You don't know which one's better. You basically go off of readability. You're like, oh, man

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:07.600
 I can't read this but I can kind of read this

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:12.240
 But there's also another element because the typescript compiler is limited on how much it can handle

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:18.480
 Right. So like trpc is a project i've been involved in and when you have like inference and like crazy stuff going on

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:21.600
 You hit a limit and the typescript compiler like hits a wall

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:25.680
 So with the with the benchmarking we can kind of help you like

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:30.080
 Identify those things. So that's a big thing. So I am

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:31.680
 Like I similar to you

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:37.920
 I'm like really into just going crazy with the types of stuff an area that I have not spent any time in is figuring out

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:40.640
 The some of those performance things and no one has

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:43.440
 Or no, exactly

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:47.120
 Yeah, but i'm like I like notice it all the time. So like I have

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:50.800
 Some new sc console for example, like we do a lot of crazy inference stuff there

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:55.360
 And i'm noticing stuff slowing down and I have no idea how to

00:32:55.360 --> 00:33:02.000
 Even profile it to figure out like what's actually going on. Is there even a better way to do this?

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.120
 Uh

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:07.520
 Yeah, that area is lacking and i'm kind of like this needs to get figured out either by

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:12.800
 The compiler getting better, which is obviously ideal. Uh, or at least like

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:15.600
 some awareness of

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:20.400
 How to do things to avoid like the things that make the compiler slow, right? Exactly

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:24.880
 So like that features like the nice to have but that's like

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:28.880
 Fat feature will tap us into because like when you think about leak code people

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:33.120
 Compare each other by like space time complexity, but it's like, okay. Well, how do we do that with typescript?

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:37.840
 Well, I guess with benchmarking it with whatever tool we're going to use, right? That's like the difference here

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:41.360
 But it's not it's not like a need for what we're going to do

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:47.440
 But it's like it's something I want because like there's obviously a spectrum of users from beginner to expert

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:51.600
 But then there's like the library authors and stuff like that. So it's like

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:56.000
 They're they tend they already kind of know typescript to like a pretty deep level

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.480
 So I don't really see them doing challenges other than like just for game

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.080
 Like like hey check out mine

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:04.080
 It's like you see that on twitter people like look at my challenge verse or look at my solution verse

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:08.000
 Like yours like andreus first like matt when they're like sharing solutions, right?

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:14.320
 Um, but then it's like but like you said like the whole like performance thing like such in from the tier pc court team

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:15.680
 He had a blog

00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:19.040
 Because he went deep down the performance bottleneck because we were trying to figure that stuff out

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:21.440
 But it's like yeah, how can I just like make that?

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.600
 consumable

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:28.240
 For like like the average person so like I can't like promise it's going to be like

00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:31.520
 Oh, it's your bottleneck is right at line five or something

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:35.120
 But we should always be like this one's this one's faster than that one

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:38.960
 Yeah, at least because right now it's a total mystery and I only really feel it in my editor

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:42.960
 And like how long the autocomplete takes it up. That's the only time you know, it's like oh, it's slowing down

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:45.200
 I guess i'm doing something wrong, right?

00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:47.440
 And that's kind of like what we do on tier pc

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:52.160
 We kind of like generated this huge type and when it breaks we know that something slowed down

00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:55.440
 You know what I mean

00:34:55.440 --> 00:35:00.320
 Yeah, it's it's crazy. I was gonna ask has anyone done like the thing that your vision sounds really cool

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:04.880
 Has has anyone done the type of thing before I imagine that probably know because

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:12.240
 You need the language to be like at a certain scale for someone that has to be really viable and types of is at such a huge scale

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:18.240
 But like are you drawing inspiration from anything? I mean i'm drawing inspiration from me really being in the type challenges and

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.080
 uh

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:24.160
 Just it's on github and github is very limited, right? So it's like yeah

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:28.640
 Like if I want to like solve something it takes me to type script playground

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:32.160
 And then it's like if I want to share the solution, I got to make a pull request and share it

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:34.720
 And then people can comment on the github platform

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:38.320
 But I wanted to just bring that all in the one place one make it look nicer

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:41.520
 So like you can literally it's literally like leave code for like type script

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:45.920
 But like some extra stuff really but then it can kind of grow into something else

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:47.840
 But that's like the base model

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:52.320
 But yeah, it just comes from like it literally just comes from my love of just doing type script challenges and

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:55.600
 Always having to share type script playgrounds and that being annoying

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:59.840
 So I just want something to like kind of like track all that stuff for me. It's more streamlined for this exact

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:05.360
 Like I can go you can go to my profile. You can see so the cool thing about this is that you'll be able to create your own challenges too

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:06.720
 So it's like all user generated

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:08.080
 So it's like if you're

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:11.760
 You know something that's really into type script, but you know, you don't really have a platform to share it

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:14.240
 You can go on our platform share something

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:16.240
 But there's like a moderation tool behind it, right?

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:18.960
 Like we don't want to anyone to just like make challenges and spam stuff

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:23.280
 But yeah, so that's like the cool part. So like the idea is like you can spotlight creators

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:27.920
 Like for instance, if we do launch would be like, okay, let me invite like a bunch of people that I know the types of community

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:35.040
 Like here's the collection of like Dax's problems. Check it out and you can go through and solve them and share your solutions upvote

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:40.560
 Share blah blah blah. But it's just like it's just a cool way to like spotlight certain creators

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:44.880
 Like right now like leeko, you can't I don't know if you can create anything. It's kind of like you have this laundry list

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:46.400
 of stuff

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:49.680
 Um, so I kind of just want to like make it more community based

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.640
 But also like the hard part about that is like, you know moderation and stuff. So we're building moderation tools behind it

00:36:54.640 --> 00:37:00.480
 Um, and then also discoverability. So obviously like we want everyone to be seen. So just be like different sections

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:03.360
 You know, this is what's hot today or just what's most recently solved

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:07.600
 Like you can kind of like you can kind of like draw on the possibilities on this like forever

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:10.640
 But that's like the mvp who's working on it with you. You keep saying we

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.240
 Is it like your community?

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:15.440
 So the cool thing is is I started this by myself and then my community was like, dude

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:22.080
 We want to help so then like 15 people jumped on and we've just like I think we probably have like a solid group of like seven

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:27.760
 Constant like contributors like every day. We're just like pushing stuff. Um, so like we went from like

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:30.960
 like here and now we're like

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:35.440
 As far as progress we're here like the launch stage is like is getting closer and closer. So it's like insane that like

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:40.720
 People were willing to rally behind me to kind of work on this

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:48.160
 Uh, so it's like been pretty pretty neat to see that like I've built a community to where people would want to help me

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:52.080
 But it also like validates my idea that people want to see it come to fruition

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:55.280
 Right and like I think like this is actually like gonna do well

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:58.080
 Mainly just because like it's just the

00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:03.680
 TypeScript's booming, right? Like if you look at any job job thing like web web dev jobs are

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:09.120
 Plenty full. I want to say plenty full, but there's a lot of them but type scripts like more or less like a standard now

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:12.080
 So like I want to be able to like

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:16.800
 So when you think about people going to leak code to practice for job interviews, right?

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:21.040
 You can go to my platform to like get better at this so you can get better your job, right?

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:26.240
 Um, but again, it's like it's a it's a flavor because some of it as you get more complex with your challenges

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:31.920
 You really don't want to go in there unless you're like a library author or you're writing like utils that are actually usable

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:36.560
 But there is like gonna be an aspect for people. I like, you know, I just want to what's a string?

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:40.160
 What's a number for all that easy stuff like so it's like something for everybody, I guess?

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:45.200
 Is this all like like I'm assuming open source? It's gonna be a little it's a close source right now

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:48.880
 But it's gonna be we've been using the app directory. This has been crazy

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:55.280
 I was like what was gonna ask what is the stack and how's it going?

00:38:55.280 --> 00:39:00.240
 So we're using app there because I was like I started out by myself and I was like, do let me just try app directory because

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:03.040
 I want to have it on everyone's talking trash about it

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:08.720
 But like I have it actually use this let me try it and then we're messing between drizzle and prisma

00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:14.320
 We have like a PR for drizzle and then we also have prisma right now. I don't know what we're gonna do

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:21.120
 Probably drizzle if I have to guess and then we're using planet scale because I just wanted to try planet scale for fun

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:26.720
 I don't know if that's actually like we're still like at a spot where we can just switch that out like it's not it's not hard, right?

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:32.560
 Um, it's just a matter of like is that important because I just want to build features and if someone wants to like tackle the

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:40.880
 dv layer they can but like yeah like we're trying to do like polymorphic like relationships and like that just doesn't exist in like prisma

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:45.920
 Um, so like we're just hitting like a lot of like weird patterns that you just can't do in prisma

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:50.400
 Yeah, so it's so I don't know. I don't even think like drizzle can do

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:52.560
 I don't know if any rms can actually do no

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:56.240
 I mean the polymorphic thing is a big problem in relational databases, right because it's like

00:39:56.240 --> 00:40:00.880
 There's a few different ways you can model them and they all suck. I just end up though in a JSON

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.720
 Column and then I'll like type I'll type it in uh because drizzle has a nice integration with zod

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:13.200
 So define the union there gotcha. Okay. I might like to talk to you offline about that because right now like we're like well

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:18.160
 We had someone else take us. We just have like separate tables to like represent these relationships and we're just like okay

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:21.680
 So now we kind of have like duplicate tables so you can imagine like maybe you have like

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:26.080
 A challenge comment you can comment on someone's challenge, but then you can comment on someone's solution

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:32.720
 We don't have like a solution comment and like a challenge comment first. Yeah, one table that kind of like helps direct that

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:37.920
 Um, I don't know. I would love to get your opinion and like how we could make it better

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:44.080
 But yeah, it's just one of those things where that is like, you know, if you go talk about the relational database normal form stuff

00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:49.120
 like the way you guys are doing it is more correct, but I find in practice that just doing it in a JSON column and

00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:55.520
 Having your application only your application understand the union is like practically like an easier thing to do with

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:59.840
 But yeah, we can we can talk about it. Um, yeah, it's one of the one of the main

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:07.280
 Like especially when you do so much type script you're you realize like how useful like unions are and like how to break the types are

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:12.400
 And you're just so used in wanting that ability everywhere and it's just such a pain

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:14.560
 Interlational database

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:20.240
 Uh, and I feel this way across like another language is too like now when I go to any language that doesn't that can't do that type of thing

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:24.080
 It's like very painful. Yeah, it's super annoying and I saw like

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:28.800
 um, some other people mentioning it and I was just kind of going down the rabbit hole and no one really has like

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:31.680
 Great solutions. I'm so like what we have right now

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:36.240
 It works like I'm like I'm like I'm like at the like we're at the point where like make it work

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:39.680
 We can make it better later kind of thing. We'll pay that tax but

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:43.920
 Yeah, oh no, but yeah as far as app directory like I wanted to have an opinion on that

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:47.760
 The dev server like I just tweeted like two days ago. I was like, please

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:52.400
 So like I think the dude from the control made them do that really funny tweet about

00:41:54.640 --> 00:42:00.320
 I hate that he ended it and then like no, I'm him. I'm like him right now because

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:06.720
 You just it's like I click on something and like if I literally have like cold starts like locally, right

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:12.640
 And I'll literally just go like scratch my foot or something and just like wait

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:16.320
 So like right now you can imagine we have like this tab container

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:19.760
 Each tab container is a route because we want to be able to deep link all those

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:23.040
 So every time you click on a tab it has to compile that thing on the fly

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:25.360
 So it's like just to interact with stuff

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:29.440
 It's like I wait like 10 seconds and then everything starts loading and like starts flickering everywhere

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.040
 And I'm like, is that a bug on my end?

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:33.360
 So I have to do like a prod build to make sure it's like, okay

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:36.560
 I'm hoping it's getting better. Everyone say it's gonna get better like right now

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:38.800
 The only pain point really is just a dev server

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:41.360
 Which is literally the entire local experience

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:45.120
 So I can't really say it's not a big deal because it is but I don't know Guillermo said he has

00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:47.200
 his best people working on it based on that

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:51.360
 No, lazy throwing 50 engineers on it. That was the man

00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:56.400
 How many people do like can you tag who's working on it?

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:57.360
 Can we double it?

00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:58.400
 Yeah

00:42:58.400 --> 00:42:59.600
 Whatever it is. Can we double it?

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:03.120
 Yeah, I think I think people get stuck on this type of thing a lot where

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:05.760
 Sometimes there's stuff that's bad because

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:07.840
 Foundationally architecturally you can never be good

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:12.160
 Uh, and like yeah, you should like worry about that or like try to avoid it

00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:15.360
 Then there's situations like this where there's actually nothing wrong foundationally

00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:19.760
 It's just that it just needs more time and that's my feeling as well like given enough time

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:22.480
 It'll be fine

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:25.040
 And it's funny because you brought the the Prisma drizzle thing

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:27.360
 Uh, so I put Prism in the other category

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:31.920
 I think if foundationally it's wrong architecturally and there's nothing you can do to fix some of the issues in it

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:35.440
 Uh, and when I like initially it was posting about drizzle people were like

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:39.680
 Oh, like no, you shouldn't use drizzle because it's missing feature a bcd

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:44.720
 Whatever, but those aren't features that are missing because there's like a foundational problem. They're just not there yet

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:45.760
 And

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:49.200
 If you're the fast forward now six months later like most of those features are there

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:53.280
 Uh, so yeah, that's why I think we're just gonna go weird phase with next day

00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:57.920
 I again, I have all these opinions about next days and I still have not used it even once

00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:01.120
 I don't even use it even once. Look at how smart I sound

00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:03.120
 Don't I sound like I wasn't talking about it?

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:05.120
 Prisma sucks, I don't use it. No

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:09.280
 But it's definitely sucks. Prisma is a different story

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:11.520
 It's a man. I can tell you

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:13.360
 I can tell you all kinds of stories, right

00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:18.720
 It's because every three days there's like some question in our help channel like how do I use Prisma with serverless?

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:22.080
 I've just spent the next 15 minutes arguing with them explaining them why

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:25.040
 It's a bad idea and it won't work. You gotta make a command

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:30.080
 You just make a command and call Prisma and they'll just explain every all the things you I started doing that

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:32.800
 You know what I did? I wrote a message where I was like

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:35.760
 I was so sick of it because I was like this isn't our problem

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:37.040
 Like this is really is not our problem

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:40.320
 We like why do we have the burden of supporting this so I wrote a message

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:41.520
 I was just like

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:46.960
 Unfortunately, like we cannot assist with problems with Prisma like we need to redirect you back to the Prisma community

00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:51.920
 And hopefully they can help you figure it out, but it was very frustrating because like for literally two years

00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:58.000
 The annoying part was we understood it very well because it's very popular

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.880
 It's almost very quickly we're like how do we help people deploy this in and in a way on the function

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:04.880
 November function and

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:09.200
 We tried really hard and we ran to all these issues and we understood what was broken into the hood

00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:13.760
 And then for years nobody believed us literally people would come to us

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:17.120
 And then we would explain this down and be like no, they said it should work

00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:20.480
 And we're just like what the like what what do you want?

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:23.360
 Like I can't I feel like getting like a weird argument with them

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:28.880
 And I think finally it's like shifted around and even this morning. I think prime stream prime rated us by the way

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:34.400
 He like he was reading some article about about these issues, but it took so long

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:36.400
 I took like two and then in those two years. I was just

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:41.920
 Support ticket after support ticket after support ticket. It's uh, it's really deep hatred in my heart

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:44.640
 Well, the main thing is like prison was just large

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:49.040
 Right. So like is that like that's contributing to like the startup time?

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:51.280
 Yeah, I think if I explain

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:56.800
 I think the way I understand it is uh, they're very ambitious early on they're like we're gonna be the rm for

00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:59.280
 Not just type script but for like many languages

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:03.520
 Uh, so if that's your goal, you wouldn't write your core and type script

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:06.080
 You'll write your core in some language that is portable

00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:09.360
 Across various places, right? So they wrote their core and rust

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:11.920
 Uh, and then they wrote like a type script

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:16.880
 Like adapter for that like calls into it like it spins with the rust thing locally that talks to database

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:21.360
 And it just has an api for types with interact with and they also built a go version of this

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:25.840
 Uh over time they realized they really were only getting adoption and type script and they dropped

00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:27.920
 the go one

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:29.920
 Uh at this point they're like very focused on type script

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:34.880
 But they still have this legacy architecture of like splitting these two things and rust binaries are very big

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:37.440
 spawning an additional process

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:42.880
 Like when when like a lambda function starts up it's just going to be slow. There's just a bunch of issues with that

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:48.160
 The size increases a lambda function called star times again. None of these are problems in a container environment

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:50.560
 Like you just wait wouldn't even notice this yeah, exactly

00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:55.440
 But with everyone deploying like using prisma and next and bracelle was like a very common pattern

00:46:55.440 --> 00:47:00.960
 Uh, a lot of our users also just defaulted the prisma and yeah, every single one of them had like two or three seconds

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:05.840
 As a productivity man everyone can just get started really fast and then you hit these things and you're like, what?

00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:10.240
 Everyone gets really fast and then annoy the shit out of me six months later. It's just kind of what uh

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:16.160
 It's kind of how it goes. So like so does jizzle kind of address like those performance issues?

00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:18.720
 Yeah, so drizzle is like we're only going to be type scripts from day one

00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:21.840
 So they roll everything in type script and their patterns are very good

00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:26.880
 So they've been able to adapt to long-running connections like a direct postgres or my single connection or like

00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:30.480
 Uh new like HTTP based api as a planet skills

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:34.560
 Uh or neon's api is or even AWS has one uh, so yeah, it's

00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:37.120
 It's worked really well

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:42.960
 It does make you know a little at least there's like two layers to drizzle. There's like a core which is like

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:47.280
 A close to sequel sequel builder. So you feel like you're mostly running sequel

00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:51.920
 Then there's like a higher relational layer which like is a very similar api to prisma

00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:54.960
 So like you think in terms of the objects and the relationships and things like that

00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:57.920
 I don't use that second part. I'm fine just doing

00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:03.280
 Like the rawr sequel feeling things that we're like keisley or whatever you call it. Yeah, exactly

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:07.040
 So we initially when we ran to the prisma problem or like, okay, we got

00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:13.280
 Like prisma is a good solutions list type safety and like knowing your steam on writing your your queries in a type safe way

00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:18.240
 So let's find something that does that we found. I've been pronouncing it kaisley. I think they're now

00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:22.080
 It's a quesela or something like that

00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:24.640
 I don't know about that for now. Maybe that's not as raw

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:27.680
 I know it's

00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:31.760
 I mean, I don't know. I don't know. I know eagle. I forget his name. I think it's like you know

00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:35.680
 He's on the he works for them, but I think he was trying to pronounce it for me. I was like, but I don't know

00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:39.440
 No, it's a it's a tough name to pronounce. That's the hardest part about that

00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:44.080
 So we found that initially but that only did the querying part into the ski and management part

00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:48.480
 And then the drizzle people it's funny because I had known about them for a while because they

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:51.840
 Like commented on something I think and I was like I retweeted and I was like, oh, this was cool

00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:55.600
 But I never actually looked into it and I finally looked into it six months later because they like

00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:58.320
 Saw me struggling with prisma on a twitch stream

00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:01.120
 They actually watched the whole stream after I streamed it

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:05.600
 Then like annotated every timestamp and was like, here's how we solve this

00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:08.240
 Here's how we solve this here's how we solve this and I was like, holy shit

00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:09.760
 The drizzle folks?

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:11.280
 Yeah, okay, okay

00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:14.640
 It was before like anyone was really using them and I was like wow one

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:19.120
 That's like brilliant of them to like go and like really like spend the time to do that and like tell me

00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:21.120
 And then it's what eventually it ended up checking them out

00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:22.960
 So what happens when you don't have any users? You just

00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:27.120
 You're just trying to get one user

00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:29.200
 Yeah

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:31.280
 And I was like, okay, this is it. This is the thing we've been looking for

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:33.360
 But man, it's been a it's been a journey

00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:34.400
 Yeah, that's awesome

00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:38.160
 So I see a lot of people using prisma for like the type generation

00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:39.760
 But then they feed that

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:41.120
 Into something else

00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:43.120
 So then they don't act to actually ship prisma

00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:45.680
 They just use it as a type as a code generator

00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:47.760
 I still find it kind of heavy

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:49.600
 I think it's absolutely like

00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:54.640
 Even the local dev part I find it kind of heavy and like drizzle skips a type generation part because all it in front

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:57.600
 But people like the prisma like file

00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:58.880
 But there's a cap on that

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:01.360
 Like depending on how big your scheme is, right?

00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:03.920
 Yeah, I do wonder when when it'll be too slow

00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:07.840
 Haven't hit it yet because I use sequel in a weird way, but

00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:10.080
 Yeah, so it's like

00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:12.080
 It's great like people use inference, right?

00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:17.120
 But it's like there's there's a limit on like how that scales like if you're like a large business

00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:20.640
 Like I don't know if you can actually use that like an afflict we've

00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:24.000
 TypeScript would just like throw up on the floor and pass out for sure

00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:30.240
 Yeah, I mean even in even the stuff that I work on like, uh, like boo me the

00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:32.720
 Me and my wife's company like that

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:35.120
 There are some parts of that that are like really starting to

00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:41.520
 Slow down and this like this needs to be sold. It's like uh, I think it's gonna be a real bottleneck for

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:45.760
 like the real vision of TypeScript to really come around

00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:48.240
 Wasn't the dude from vorcel dawn making uh

00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:51.280
 Tw yeah

00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:57.040
 Did you stop working on it? I can't remember. No dude. I loved I love this because I remember

00:50:57.040 --> 00:51:01.760
 I've been following on twitter for a while and I remember what he used to sound like before he started working on it

00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:09.040
 Dude, hey, he just said he has the most depressing tweets and he's like, do I even like programming?

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:12.960
 It's just what I still want to do. He feels like he was like I'm thinking about just giving this repo to somebody

00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:18.880
 Will somebody save me? It's just like the most like just blank stare like no

00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:24.880
 It's it took everything out of him. It's like it goes from like passion to just like despair

00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:29.600
 I'm like, oh man. Yeah, he's been like that for like like over a year now

00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:31.680
 So I think he just he just fucks

00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:34.720
 I think he hit a wall where like he could do most of this stuff

00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:39.120
 But then the last like 20 percent was like, I don't know if I can actually make it work

00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:43.840
 I'm just like it's tricky though because the TypeScript team also said that their issues aren't

00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:46.480
 the language

00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:52.800
 Like they don't feel like rewriting it in a faster language would yield enough to be worth it

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:53.600
 Right

00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:55.040
 At least that was their last position

00:51:55.040 --> 00:52:00.640
 Do they actually talk about like do they talk about the performance issues and like long-term plans?

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:02.880
 I don't know if they're gonna do anything about it. I have no idea

00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:04.880
 I haven't heard anything

00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:10.480
 Is it just not a problem for most people? Is it only like very specific use cases or is it

00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:14.080
 After you get to a certain point of complexity, it's going to be slow

00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:17.920
 I think as TypeScript has gotten more feature rich people, it's like

00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:21.280
 When it gets 10 more features, there's like

00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:24.320
 200 more opportunity to do stuff with it

00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:26.240
 So I think that's kind of what we're experiencing now

00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:30.000
 Like it's got hit a threshold where we just all started doing really crazy shit with it

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.400
 Not pointless stuff. I really useful stuff

00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:37.200
 Yeah, so then they maybe just caught them off guard. Yeah, I don't really know

00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:41.120
 I haven't heard anything but it's TypeScript like it's the type system in TypeScript

00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:44.560
 So much better than other options

00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:48.880
 So as to deal with the the disaster that is JavaScript on the back end

00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:54.800
 I mean just all of the no JS and npm baggage like ultimately TypeScript

00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:57.920
 It's a great experience and I mean

00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:03.120
 I'm not gonna say it's bad. I just like there are so there's so much baggage in JavaScript land

00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:05.440
 Are there not other type systems that are good enough?

00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:10.000
 Well, the obvious one was flow which never took off that stayed at Facebook

00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:12.320
 Well, I wasn't even talking JavaScript like other languages

00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:18.720
 Yeah, like if they're not other options for back-end languages that give us 80% of the type system

00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:21.600
 Whatever you guys like about advanced TypeScript

00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:25.200
 Well, there's like a few things right there. Okay, just a type system on its own

00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:29.120
 I do think there are better type systems, but I'm not talking about the insane ones

00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:31.280
 I I like the whole

00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:33.600
 ML of camel family of like type systems

00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:37.760
 I think that I in the best parts of TypeScript like when you write TypeScript well

00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:39.920
 You're pretty much writing it in that style

00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:45.040
 Uh, the difference is TypeScript has support more than that has support all of JavaScript is why

00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:47.200
 It's like their scope is wider

00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:52.560
 So there is I think there is some excitement around the the languages that are coming out of that family

00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:54.960
 And they even just even the ones that I compiled to JavaScript

00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:59.680
 Uh, it's just not the ecosystem just isn't isn't there yet. Uh, so for me

00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:01.440
 I'm still sticking to TypeScript

00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:06.080
 But if you look at some of the performance characteristics of like rescript and this is from a while ago

00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:08.000
 But like it is so fast

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:09.120
 Is that a reason ML?

00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:12.400
 Yeah, there was like a reason ML and they split into rescript and now there's like

00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:17.040
 Melange, I don't even know how you're gonna pronounce it, but that's like a fork of the older

00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:19.920
 It's it's complicated

00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:25.760
 But the compilation times on that are like insane like blows TypeScript out of the water

00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:29.840
 But it's very specifically because they're not trying to support all of JavaScript

00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:33.680
 They're just trying to support a subset, right, which makes their job a lot easier

00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:36.720
 I guess I just feel like there's so many things

00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:44.160
 That I've heard you Dax even complain about in terms of the quality of the package ecosystem in JavaScript land

00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:46.960
 I mean node is a runtime

00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:48.720
 Not the best

00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:50.880
 Like there's just so many things that I feel like

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:53.200
 JavaScript on the back end has against it

00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:56.000
 But why why do you still is it?

00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:00.080
 It's just literally just because you want to write the same language front and back like that's basically the main

00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:05.520
 Main reason for choosing it. I mean there's a number of reasons while you would do that for an engineering work

00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:10.640
 I mean one example is right you've write one language everywhere. That's like as far as productivity

00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:14.560
 That's what the business probably values more is you being productive, right?

00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:18.640
 So well on that point like we don't but if we're doing stuff across the stack

00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:20.960
 We're writing other languages like we have to write HTML

00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:25.120
 We have to write like we have to do all this markup and other things that are context switches

00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:27.760
 Like we use a lot of tools

00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:32.240
 Whereas like I don't understand quite the value of like I'm writing TypeScript in my

00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:36.400
 Page and I'm also writing it in my back-end handler

00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:40.400
 When I could just use a different language on the back end and not deal with all the ecosystem issues

00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:42.640
 So I have a few requirements for this so oh

00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:46.560
 Well, also what you're describing is how I spent most of my career most my career

00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:50.080
 I did not write jobs from the back end and in fact for a long time when people would say

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:53.920
 We're switching to node to have one language across stack. I didn't really understand the value

00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:57.520
 I was like I don't get it like I'm writing two languages and it's and it's entirely fine

00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:04.000
 Uh, so it makes it like C# go elixir on the back end while obviously always writing jobs from the front end

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.480
 Uh or jobs for TypeScript. So

00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:11.280
 Now having gone the other way where like okay, I actually have used it in a full stack way

00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:13.120
 There are like a lot of like

00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:16.880
 As painful as some of it is now that I've like learned it

00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:18.800
 Uh

00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:21.680
 I don't really deal with the badness of the ecosystem

00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:26.080
 The only time I feel the badness of the ecosystem is when I'm trying to support other people

00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:28.960
 As a good depth tool engineer to like support their projects

00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:35.120
 Terrible choice. Yeah, I'm like you guys have made bad decisions because the ecosystem really allows for some really terrible decisions and requires

00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:38.960
 Probably a lot of knowledge to make good ones. Yeah, so I don't personally feel on my projects

00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:42.160
 But I do see it how like the average project is not set up well

00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:46.400
 And but also I have seen the benefit of writing the same language across the stack

00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:51.920
 It's not something that is impossible not to do again. Most companies I think do have split languages or like historically

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:58.880
 That's been the case, but I just see how much better I get. It's not the like like tries to the productivity

00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:03.760
 Um, but you're also just getting better at it. No matter what you're doing if I'm writing infrastructure code

00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:06.960
 I'm getting better if I'm writing fun and code. I'm getting better from writing back in code

00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:09.840
 I'm getting better instead of like getting better at two different skills

00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:12.160
 Is that worth it?

00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:14.080
 Uh, I personally don't think I would cling to it

00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:18.560
 And I'm happy to switch to a different language on the back end. The only thing I really be giving up this point is

00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:24.000
 Like all the inference stuff you probably introduce more code gen steps to like get types into the front end

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.160
 Yeah, annoying, but you can figure it out

00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:32.320
 But there actually is not a good option because the requirements I have is a very good expressive type system

00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:36.800
 And a solid ecosystem where i'm not like writing my own clients for AWS

00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:43.440
 Apis things like that. Yeah, the only thing that fits in that category close is go with a go type system is terrible

00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:46.720
 Uh, so i'm looking i'm searching and i'm happy to switch

00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:50.800
 But nothing is really hit hit what I need. Yeah, I hear people get so excited about

00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:54.880
 Like teaj talks about oh camo so much and the type system so amazing

00:57:54.880 --> 00:58:01.200
 But but immediately my question is like the deployment picture coming from like an infrastructure back end or background

00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:05.360
 It's like how does oh cam will fit into I want to deploy this stuff

00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:08.800
 To AWS lambda functions or some other

00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:15.680
 Random cloud provider like I don't know that that deployment picture and I guess is that what you mean by the ecosystem? Like

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:20.080
 Yeah, yeah, so I mean the ecosystem on the on that's was like point is like in my control

00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:24.560
 Because we would just add oh camo support to ssc which wouldn't be a ton of work really

00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:28.000
 Uh, and it's just a custom runtime for lambda is that basically?

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.200
 It's actually what's great about oh camo. It's actually not a custom runtime

00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:37.840
 It's a zero runtime like you don't incur the overhead of a custom runtime because you can just compile it natively and just runs raw

00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:42.160
 So it's similar to go or rust where it would have really great cold start characteristics

00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:47.600
 Yeah, I just haven't I just haven't done it yet because no one actually does this and no one's asked me for it

00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:53.520
 No one's asked me for oh camo lambdas. Well, we're asking you now me and on behalf of teach. I'm asking you

00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:55.840
 For okay. Can we go camo lambdas?

00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:58.880
 Okay, I'm does yeah

00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:02.320
 But like you know just the overall picture of like there's

00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:07.040
 Tenors, there's like a couple things I just need I need like again AWS SDK support

00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:10.400
 So is there a good AWS APIs is there a really good database?

00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:14.480
 Like interface like we have drizzle and typescript now. Is there something comparable?

00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:18.880
 Uh, so there's like there's like a handful of things I need along with a good site type system

00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:22.000
 And I haven't figured that out for any other language really so

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:26.560
 As of now, I'm I'm here. I'll like if I have a performance issue

00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:30.480
 I probably will drop down to go like swap a function with go just to make it run faster

00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:34.160
 So it's nice and better set up like just one part of your application can be different language. Yeah

00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:35.760
 um

00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:41.040
 But yeah again like I I want it and I'm not satisfied, but I just don't see what the option is

00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:44.160
 Okay, so we're all stuck with types good. Go ahead trash. Yeah, I was gonna say like

00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:48.720
 I don't think I've ever worked at a company where we actually wrote the same language on the front end and back end

00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:51.760
 It's always been a different language and like I come from a similar

00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:58.880
 Background is DAX maybe not similar, but like I I've never wrote JavaScript on the back end specifically I came from like C# Java whatever

00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:00.720
 but like

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:04.880
 I've seen the productivity like boost from just doing typescript

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:09.120
 I don't I think like if I was gonna approach this from like an engineering leadership perspective

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:15.280
 If I had the same language on both front and back and I can I can get more mileage out of one engineer, right?

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:17.040
 whereas

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:18.000
 I would

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.600
 Either not to find like an actual flow stack developer that doesn't actually really exist

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:28.320
 Or have like two separate teams which a lot of companies do that back end team that specializes in and they have a UI team, right?

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:31.920
 But then it's like the communication complication was like jrpc or something

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:37.520
 Whereas if you use like a model repo approach with typescript like you don't that's kind of abstracted away from me

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:42.160
 You don't really notice it, right? But then you're in a model repo and then that comes with its own set of problems, right?

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:45.120
 I don't yeah, like I don't know what a good solution is like

01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:49.760
 I haven't actually seen like big projects used typescript from front and back end

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:51.040
 That just could be from my ignorance

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.480
 I'm not looking for it to be honest

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:59.200
 So to probably exist a lot of that but from like all the big companies I've been at or like companies at scale like it's always been

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:04.000
 Like in my opinion like if you want performance, you probably don't watch out in the script, right?

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.720
 So yeah, I think it's starting to happen now because I think our audience is

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:12.960
 Mostly typescript on the back end. I would say the second highest is probably go

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:20.080
 And we typically like you're not going to use sst for like a random side project. It's usually for like

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:23.040
 like companies

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:27.200
 It's starting if it actually feels new even though jobs on the back end has been around forever

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:32.000
 I didn't deployment story around it has made it so some of the performance

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:36.080
 But the traditional performance questions are now solved in a different way

01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:38.560
 like it doesn't matter if

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:40.480
 My little

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:47.840
 Single threaded JavaScript code is slow if I have the tools to easily like parallelize it across like a thousand parallel indications, right?

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:50.720
 Um, that's become a lot simpler to do now

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:55.920
 So we're seeing a lot more like real bigger companies use it on the back end like it's starting to get more serious

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:57.920
 I think that's why there's a lot more demand now

01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:03.200
 Like I think you're seeing people come from these other ecosystems where they had better package managers

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:05.840
 They had better packages and they're like, what the hell is this garbage?

01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:08.080
 Like why isn't this better?

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:13.120
 So i'm optimistic that it's more likely that will make the jobs would ecosystem better than when this like

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:16.480
 Mythical thing that I want will actually show up from scratch

01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:22.720
 Uh, that's that's that's where my head is right now. It's always gonna be common. Yes and esm forever

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:32.640
 No, we need to kill common jazz. That's another thing. All right, time out. I'm gonna I'm gonna switch this topic quick

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:37.200
 Were you guys making this gaming platform? What happened to that? Oh rebase?

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:39.280
 Yes

01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:44.000
 Yeah, yeah, the game show. Yeah, we're still making it. I mean, it's we've been a little busy with

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:49.200
 Other things. I've been I've been waiting for it. I've been waiting for it. It's happening. I mean this year

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:50.640
 Like it's happening

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:53.440
 This year right decks. Yeah, we need to catch up on a little bit

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:57.280
 But it definitely is something we're still gonna do we made a good amount of progress on it

01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:02.160
 It's like it's actually not a big thing to build just like the initial some of that initial stuff is like

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:06.080
 It's like it's very simple than the day, but me and adam like to go

01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:10.560
 Pretty hard. You're just pushing the boundaries. Yeah, because it's like

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:14.960
 And I felt this way about everything that I work on and this is gonna be interesting things

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:16.800
 I'm talking to linear

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:19.680
 founder next week and this is like a topic I want to talk about where

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:24.720
 Uh, sometimes your idea is just the same thing that's been around forever

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:28.720
 But the execution being at a much higher bar is your differentiator

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:31.840
 Uh, so that's the way I've like generally thought about things

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:36.320
 So I tend to it's a little bit counter to like the ship garbage and like iterate on it later

01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:38.720
 I still kind of do that but

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:42.720
 Like my I like need things to be at a certain bar. Yeah. Yeah, so this is actually

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:45.200
 It's a segue into a question I have for you trash

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:49.120
 Which is like I think about our problem of like time and bandwidth

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:52.400
 If we just like opened it up and said like we could get people to help us

01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:58.320
 How is that gone for you like do you have certain standards of things you want to see like

01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:03.120
 Just like how the app functions or maybe the the quality of what's being

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:09.040
 Even produced. Is it been like a train wreck having seven people jump in and just like start pushing PRs

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:14.160
 How is that gone for you from a cold start of you're just working on it to now you've got all these people?

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:16.160
 No, it's actually been very good because

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:21.040
 Obviously, I didn't just say I didn't just open the floodgates and be like who wants to contribute at first like the first

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:24.000
 Like initial people where people I just know from the community

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:29.280
 And they're all like pretty good engineers. So so far like and they're like better than me in like other areas

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:33.680
 So it's like they can like we pretty much like have a nice well-rounded little core team

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:36.080
 But it's been great like but the the cool part is

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:40.320
 Is relating like people that are trying to learn like limited amount

01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:42.720
 But people are trying to learn so we have like a bunch of good first issues

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:45.280
 I've been kind of wearing my like project manager hat and just like

01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:48.960
 Making the board nice so people can actually be productive and know what they need to do

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:53.280
 Um, yeah, so like we have like tickets for everybody right for like all around the stack

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:59.040
 But yeah, everything everything's been like surprisingly good to be honest like we don't really we're kind of like in the

01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:02.960
 Make it work phase and maybe tweak it better but like

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:08.400
 A lot of the really complex problems things to like just libraries and tools that exist today

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:11.600
 like it's kind of hard to like mess things up terribly

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:13.760
 because

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:17.280
 You're kind of set in these guardrails almost like you can mess it up for sure

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:21.440
 You can write shitty code, but it can't be like so terribly a bit like I can glance at it and be like

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:25.200
 Oh, this is shit. Like fix it. Yeah, none of those scenarios have happened

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:30.960
 Yeah, I I think less about the code quality more just like I want it to work a certain way or I want like

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:34.240
 Just imagining the front end people coming in and pushing prs

01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:37.920
 Stresses me out like I would be so overbearing about

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:43.200
 How the thing looks and works. Yeah, you kind of have to learn to let that go a little bit

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:46.560
 Because it's like I'd rather have something than nothing to build on

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:49.200
 Um, but to be honest, it's like

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:52.080
 Like I said the platform is almost like kind of like leak code

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:56.960
 So it's like you can kind of go to their platform and be like make some assumptions on how behaviors should be

01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:02.000
 You know, I mean, so it's not like like we're not making something like brand brand new for sure

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.040
 But we're basically taking an existing platform and

01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:10.720
 Repurposing it for our needs so we have something to go off of it's like almost as if you're making like a twitter clone

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:14.800
 But instead of twitter, it's just like programming code snippets or some shit, you know what I mean?

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:18.640
 Um, so it's like we're not started from completely nothing like ux patterns

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:22.800
 We can pretty much grab from there or tweak it to our own benefit

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:28.640
 Um, so it hasn't been hasn't been good. We actually have this one other engineer that joined who like

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:31.680
 Is actually like a tailwind master

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:33.200
 so

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:36.640
 Like I haven't it's been a while since like i've worked with someone and like i've been like wow

01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:42.720
 You're like actually good at front end like like making shit look good and not like animations. I'm like oh my god

01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:45.280
 I was like, all right. You're the you're the tailwind guy or whatever

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:50.480
 So it's like that's been like super helpful to just see like all these different skill sets kind of kind of merged together

01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:56.160
 Um, but yeah, it's good. It's great. It's great. Okay. If you want to send your little community when they're done once you've shipped

01:06:56.160 --> 01:07:01.440
 You want to send them over to us? We've got we've got a project they can help us. Let's read. I'm that when I'm done

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:03.600
 I'm down to help for sure

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:07.040
 I'm just like I always love building like I feel like if I'm not building I just

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:14.880
 I'm really bored. I guess. Yeah, do you guys? I'm sure like like do you ever get so like I know you had like the stat museum?

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:16.320
 You had the sst thing

01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:20.480
 Are you at some point or have you ever felt where like you're like man? I kind of I just want to like

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:24.400
 Do something else? Yeah, I was gonna say this earlier when you were talking about it

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:28.000
 I think with all the different things that we could spend time on

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:33.840
 It's really nice when there's harmony with all of it and I think I've gotten to a place where

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:38.080
 It's really lucky and I'm really grateful for it. Like there is a lot of harmony between it, right?

01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:39.920
 There's like yeah, I love building

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:44.960
 I want to build stuff and I had pretty much can work on whatever I feel like makes sense

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:49.200
 Right. So the last couple months has been a lot of fun and work building the new sst console

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:51.920
 Uh, but all that is open source. So that means I get to

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:55.520
 Remit when I feel like it none of the treatment on days. I don't want to

01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:58.000
 Uh, and I get to talk about it

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.440
 On twitter and like, you know make fun of people and then do all the stuff I love to do

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.880
 And then once it's launched and I get to do marketing for it like

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:07.520
 Whatever it is

01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:12.080
 Yes, my my dev rel duties

01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:16.640
 Uh, then I get to like make videos with people that I think are cool and like we'd have fun and we mix up together

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:18.800
 So I think I find harmony

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:23.760
 There's like a single thing I'm working on that I'm really excited like you said like you're really into the thing you're building

01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:29.440
 Uh, and then actually I can kind of express it in like every category of thing that that I can do

01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:33.040
 So I know that's super rare and it's hard stuff to align that way, but

01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:35.760
 Yeah, I think me having

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:36.960
 Um

01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:41.840
 Me having that just makes it so I can just work on this stuff forever and like not really get tired of it

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:47.200
 Which is really the only that matters. Yeah, I think that's kind of like your environment is kind of where I kind of thrive in

01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:51.840
 Where like I can tell like you and your your teammates. You guys are like good friends, right?

01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:53.280
 Yeah, exactly

01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:58.240
 So that's like one element, but it's also like the freedom to be like working on what you think should be priority

01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:03.600
 And that's like the best part in my opinion. It's like you don't you don't you're working on it because you want to you're not working

01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:08.080
 I mean sometimes you obviously have to work on something because at a necessity, but being able to like

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:12.800
 Be like I want to do this because I think it's important and also maybe because I also think it's exciting

01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:19.040
 Um, so like those are like the best things. What about you? I don't yeah, I think like before I went back to statin use

01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:23.200
 There were periods where I would just drift away from doing

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:29.440
 Building you know like just getting my hands dirty. I got just when I was messing around too much on twitch or on twitter

01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:35.760
 And then I would start to realize like I'm just too disconnected from actual technology. I'm not doing enough

01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:38.240
 I think since I've been back at statmuse. I've got some pretty

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:41.920
 Specific things that I'm pushing pretty hard on so that's that's helped

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:47.600
 Uh, but I've been known to be like hey, I could do this thing. I definitely like

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:53.760
 Always have new things. I want to start. I think I am addicted to like the green field startup a new project

01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:54.960
 Thing

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:57.120
 Uh, and then abandon it at some point

01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:02.400
 I think that's like one kind of thing that I noticed when I so like to take this back to the earlier conversation

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:04.320
 I was kind of saying how I was tailoring back

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:11.920
 My like interaction with internet. It's like I kind of felt where I was spending too much time there and actually getting worse

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:17.040
 At like programming because I just wasn't programming enough. I was instead of coding

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:20.640
 I was just reading people's opinions on twitter that were absolutely shit anyways

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:22.720
 and like

01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:26.000
 And then like I just had like no no connection to be like well

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:30.480
 I can say an opinion, but I don't actually believe in it because I don't know because I haven't tried it

01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:34.640
 Right. So it's been a person that's like if I want to try something or have an opinion

01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:36.720
 I have to build something with it

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:40.400
 And then I can actually feel like I can bring value to the conversation where I think twitter

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:43.280
 That's just not a thing. I mean, there's definitely people on twitter

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:49.440
 I've actually there's a subset of people that I go to or like read to actually like take serious like

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:55.120
 Information in but most of it. It's like you don't you don't like maybe you know what you're talking about

01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:56.800
 But I don't actually trust you

01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:59.760
 Um, so I'm gonna go like do it myself and then like

01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:04.560
 Come from my own perspective at it, but I also just don't like arguing on twitter in general

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:08.160
 I just like I mean, I like arguing but not about tech and just like being mean in general

01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:12.080
 Come back to the east coast trash. We miss you

01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:16.720
 Yeah, like I think um

01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:21.040
 I think DAX's account is like a great like new addition

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:25.280
 At least to my feed because like I think everyone knows DAX is really or you do too

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:31.120
 You both are like very knowledgeable in the like serverless space or whatever space you guys like outside of that

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:35.200
 But at the same time, it's like you're also like a shit poster

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:37.600
 And you can just like make fun of people

01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:40.160
 But then like when someone tries to like be like actually you're like well

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:43.680
 No, actually and then it's like it's like the we like we like

01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:48.240
 At least on my feed there's like a lot of that missing so it's like great to like kind of see that stuff

01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:52.560
 But now like we're running out of serverless stuff to talk about so now DAX is like reaching real hard

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:58.560
 I know man. I'm running out of side

01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:02.720
 I said is I ran out of smart stuff to stay like two months ago or so and I've just been

01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:07.440
 Grandma and son. I was like man DAX is smart. I'm like, oh and now he's degrading. Oh, he's degrading

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:13.680
 If we talk about anything else though DAX like the first time I talked with any like

01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:15.680
 With you about any topic that we've never talked about

01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:17.520
 I think you do have smart things to say about it

01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:21.840
 Like somehow you've been very well-rounded in life like you've you've got a lot of inputs

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:26.080
 I told you we've already talked about why I've just read the right 10 books 10 books

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:28.080
 Yeah, I still can't believe you

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:32.800
 I can't imagine DAX being like my director. I'll be like dude. You're like really mean

01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:38.560
 I can't imagine that's why I posted that the other day because I was like wait

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:42.880
 I was a director of engineering like that's insane. Why the hell did anyone let that happen?

01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:44.720
 Uh

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:46.400
 Yeah, I was in a pure management room

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:48.560
 It's like I've been in like engineering leadership positions too

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:51.200
 And I kind of feel back because it's like I can imagine like my old

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:54.960
 Coworkers seeing my twitter and be like what the hell like is this?

01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:59.520
 Yeah, I know I think my whole time because I know the stupid between two nerds episodes

01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:02.400
 I do get posted in my old company slack and I'm like

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:06.880
 Are they just like remember when this dude was like deciding whether I get a razor or not?

01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:12.080
 I think about that stuff constantly to be honest

01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:15.760
 I'm like is this actually gonna hurt me at some point? I don't think so because I don't really say like

01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:22.560
 Two-two spicy things, but yeah, I definitely uh think about it sometimes. Yeah, yeah, I think the way I think about it

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:24.560
 I think I've narrowed

01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:27.280
 My like range of places I could work

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:30.320
 But also I think I've like the places where I could work

01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:32.320
 I think would be like very excited to have me

01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:35.040
 Right, so I think it's kind of like that trade-off probably somewhere for anyone

01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:37.840
 Kind of doing this stuff that we do. Yeah, I mean, that's like the perspective

01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:42.000
 I have like they'll pie hire me because they're excited to want to work with me and outside of that

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:46.240
 Like I think like after like I'm done with like the Netflix spiel. I'm probably gonna go back to

01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:48.400
 the scrappy

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:53.040
 Like smaller companies because I I miss that for sure and that's why I kind of smash my child side

01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:54.400
 just to like

01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:58.160
 Do stuff. I'm not saying like the stuff I'm doing on Netflix is like boring or anything. It's it's fine

01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:02.480
 But just different. Yeah, it's just different for sure for sure

01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:05.680
 But like the cool thing about like Netflix. It's not like other big companies where there's a lot of

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:10.080
 Decisions that need to be made above you before you can actually act on them

01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:14.400
 It's like we have like this freedom and responsibility. They're like, do you think it's a good idea?

01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:19.360
 I'm like, yeah, like go fucking do it. I'm like, all right, man. Just don't fire me if it doesn't go well

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:25.760
 So like that's like something about it, right? So yeah, that's like one thing I do appreciate about like that company

01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:31.120
 But I do miss like just small we'll work together at a big company. I never should be so funny

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:37.760
 Oh, that'd be fun. That's why open source exists. You just work on open source projects. No, but it's funnier for all out of big company

01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:39.760
 While I look at this. Yeah, we're like

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:44.000
 You find our Twitter. We're just talking shit about our manager

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:49.600
 Dude, this is nobody was talking about or like he's like watching this stream. He's like, I think they're talking about me

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:58.880
 I actually worry about that because my manager he I know he's aware of like

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:01.680
 My twitch stream and stuff

01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:07.280
 So like I'm like I have to be like somewhat conscious of what I say nowadays, but not too much

01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:10.480
 I don't I don't care like too too bad. I don't say like I have common sense

01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:13.920
 They're like not speak for the behalf of like the company and stuff, but you know

01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:19.360
 Yeah, I hate I hate knowing who watched like when I found out my parents watched my stream. Oh my god

01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:24.560
 I just hate it. It hurts so good. It just like everything I say I think through that lens

01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:29.520
 It's not like I even like try not to say things that I would have said. It's just you're thinking about that

01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:32.240
 They're in the back of your head. That's literally why I got off facebook

01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:35.040
 My parents made an account like x years ago. And I was like, I'm gone

01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:38.960
 Actually, my mom looked at my linkedin profile like last week

01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:44.480
 And I just like just straight up cringe. I was like fuck she like she found me. She forget where your works

01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:49.200
 I mean she has no idea what I do. She's like you just you just code and stuff. I'm like, yeah

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:52.880
 They don't care. They're just doing they're retired. They're doing their own thing

01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:57.760
 It's it's the opposite for me. My job is literally to make fun of my manager publicly

01:15:57.760 --> 01:15:58.480
 So

01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:01.200
 Hey, is your is Jay the is Jay your boss?

01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:02.720
 You see oh, yeah

01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:06.800
 Is there like is there others is he is there like other co-founders or is he like the one?

01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:12.320
 No, so there's uh, there's three of us total. So like obviously these titles man nothing when there's just three people

01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:13.520
 Yeah

01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:15.680
 Jay just technically has to do this shit that

01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:21.840
 The CEO's have to do like talk to v season and all that he actually he is a very good CEO though

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:23.840
 he's like very good at

01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:31.120
 Setting like thinking really hard about stuff and setting direction correctly. Um, I like very much like the way he thinks about things

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:34.560
 Uh, there's him and Frank. They originally started the company together

01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:37.040
 uh, then and then I joined them like

01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:38.400
 like

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:43.600
 It's been me two years. It's only been two years. I think that's kind of what I want next is like a really small company like that

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:47.120
 After like my kids grow up because I just have not enough time

01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:49.840
 But I kind of like I do like I do like working hard

01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:53.440
 I think working hard is great. If you're if it's still working. I want to do all right

01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:55.680
 Is it work you want to do you let people you want to you work with it?

01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:57.600
 Just like there's nothing better. It's just so fun

01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:59.280
 Exactly like I work

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:04.160
 So like I just I jumped around companies a lot and I stayed on one company for six years simply because we were just like

01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:08.240
 It was like I was working with my best friends. So it's like we would just be like saying next to each other

01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:10.320
 This work for good socks

01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:13.680
 But like next to each other it was like this sucks. It's but we're like

01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:21.120
 But we're smiling it's like I left a long time ago. They're all still there, but yeah, it's it's it's amazing

01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:24.000
 Like the power of like relationships can do to like yeah

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.000
 Like it's it's nice when you find those people because like even if sst fails

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.880
 I'm sure that three of us are gonna continue to work together like 100 potentially forever and whatever the next thing is so

01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:35.680
 Yeah, I just feel good to get to have that

01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:39.760
 Yeah, small companies are where it's at. I agree. I mean like

01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:45.440
 I can I know we're at time. I got but I could just like talk about that forever of like the whole dynamic of all that stuff

01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:47.760
 It's good. I miss it. I miss it

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:54.640
 We can all start a company together one day. It'll be complete. It'll definitely fail 100% will definitely fail

01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:59.200
 We're not gonna agree on a tech stack. We're never gonna skip the first version, but we can try it

01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:02.240
 We'll ship Prisma and drizzle side-by-side. Oh my god

01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:07.840
 People can pass an inquiry parameters to whatever one they want the backend to use

01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:10.880
 Like it's like speed slow speed fast

01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:16.880
 All right, I got I got to get to work soon

01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:19.760
 Yeah, we should probably yeah, we should in this is fun

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:25.840
 Just like there's no like I messaged out right before this. I'm like is there like questions or something?

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:28.640
 No, we don't prepare

01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:30.720
 We don't have time for that

01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:33.040
 On back on the hard work thing real quick before we get off here

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:38.320
 Is it really hard work like I've had those periods where I was super excited about like a small group of people

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:42.960
 Work on a project like even at stat news where there's like three of us and we're shipping this thing and we're moving fast

01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:45.040
 And we're putting in crazy time

01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:48.640
 But I don't know if you can call it hard work because nothing about it is hard

01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:49.920
 like

01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:53.680
 Yes, it is a lot of time, but if you just like played a video game you love all day

01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:55.920
 You wouldn't call that hard work. So like

01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:58.400
 Is it hard work?

01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:03.280
 You know I'm saying no, it's it's hard work that comes easily. Yeah, I think it's uh, it's it's never been

01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:08.320
 like if you look at it externally people might see all the hours I put in or like

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:13.680
 uh, just like the amount of stuff I'm outputting or like the amount of energy I'm exerting and it's a lot but

01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:17.280
 Does it feel hard to choose to do like no?

01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:21.760
 Like right like nothing about it for yourself. It's hard. You want to do it

01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:25.440
 You're enjoying every second of it. It does feel bad

01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:26.800
 You liked it, but it feels bad

01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:29.440
 It's like doing a workout where like kind of feels bad

01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:32.320
 But you're having maybe you're into the work or you're playing a sport

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:37.600
 Like you like playing the sport, but it's like like it feels bad in the sense that if you haven't been like you've been neglecting everything else

01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:41.520
 You've just kind of been like sprinting on something you start to feel that

01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:45.840
 Yeah, or you're like or you feel like shit at the end of some days or like there's like some

01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:50.640
 A couple hours where they're just like a million things you need to do when you're kind of scattered like there's just like

01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:54.080
 Yeah moments of stress like that. So they're definitely negative

01:19:54.080 --> 01:20:00.880
 With it, but yeah, I don't feel like hard work would be like washing windows all day. Yeah, that's very different

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:05.920
 Yeah, it's I definitely wouldn't equate it to like doing stuff that you hate because you have to

01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:11.280
 That's like truly truly hard work. It's interesting like I I guess like in some of those senses

01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:14.560
 I would be labeled as a hard worker. It's just interesting to think about like

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:17.760
 My psychology while I was in those periods

01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:21.600
 Like I was enjoying it and I was it was a fun thing to do

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:28.000
 But that that's hard work. You're a hard worker. I think we're talking among the people that can choose to not

01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:36.160
 Do that. Uh, if you can choose to work hard or not work hard. Oh, I see like, you know, there's like a lot of people in that category

01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:39.440
 I think that's I think we're just talking relative to that. Yeah, that makes sense

01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:42.960
 This is our 40th episode. Do you know that? Wow

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:44.640
 Wow

01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:50.640
 40 episodes or still haven't written a review with someone please write a review no one's a review at all

01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:56.240
 I don't think so. I mean, there's like all the different platforms. I guess maybe on some weird one like pod rocket or whatever

01:20:56.960 --> 01:21:10.240
 I don't know if somebody could write one on apple or just like even rate it. That'd be good people post about it on twitter

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:15.440
 Just like redirect that and I know we get kind messages. We know people are downloading it

01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:17.200
 I don't know if they're listening to it

01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:22.080
 But if you could write something please somebody tell us on one of the platforms apple preferably

01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:27.120
 Okay, now I just got really to be honest. I don't even know how to relieve a review of I actually don't either

01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:30.400
 I've never left a podcast or this and I'm like, no idea what we're talking about do

01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:33.280
 And I'm sure they have no idea either who the hell leaves podcast reviews

01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:38.640
 Well, if somebody figures it out, please let us know so we can continue to shittle that message right tutorial. Oh, there you go

01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:42.480
 Make a little video about it at twitter thread. Yeah, right?

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:48.880
 Yeah, okay. We should probably go. Okay. All right. See you all right. Bye twitch everybody. Bye. Bye

01:21:52.400 --> 01:22:02.400
 [Music]
