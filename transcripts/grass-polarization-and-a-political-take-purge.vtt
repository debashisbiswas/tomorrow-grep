00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080
 - Are you on drugs? - I'm not.

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.660
 (upbeat music)

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:28.080
 - Okay, I dropped my fork.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.040
 - It touched my foot.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.920
 What's the rule?

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:30.840
 Can I still use it?

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.680
 - Just eat it.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.960
 It's your own foot.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.400
 - But it's a foot.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.760
 I mean, feeder, maybe the gross is part of me.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.600
 - Oh my God.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.440
 I forgot what you're like.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.760
 - What do you mean you forgot what I was like?

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.260
 We just talked on Dennis's.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.120
 - So, no, I'm like remembering that you're insane.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.920
 It's just, it's just to eat it.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:48.760
 I don't know what's good for you.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.600
 - Okay, I'm gonna, I'm gonna eat it.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.560
 I gotta find the apple chunk that fell as well.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.040
 - You gotta eat that too.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.000
 - Oh, there was no apple chunk, the fork fell by.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.640
 (laughing)

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.240
 - The rest of the apple chunk was in the bowl.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.960
 - You're not helping your case.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.240
 - No, guys, this is the least amount of substances

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.800
 that have been in my body for a couple of weeks.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.440
 That didn't make a good case.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.960
 Wow, do I really sound high?

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.360
 I'm not high.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.520
 I stayed up till 1.30 AM.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.480
 - Okay.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.080
 - Which is super atypical for me.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.640
 It's why you were late today to ask.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.680
 Why were you so late, by the way?

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.880
 - You actually had me, you got me for a second.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.040
 I was like, was I late?

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.720
 - Did you say something confidently enough?

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.280
 - No, I stayed, in the case you and I were up super late

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.640
 because I had an emotion.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.240
 - Oh yeah, you said that you cried yesterday.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.000
 - Oh, I wasn't gonna say that on the podcast,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.840
 but okay, I guess.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.680
 - Oh, you cut it out.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.520
 - You say something on Twitter.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.600
 - You said it on Twitter, dude.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.920
 - I said it to nobody.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.320
 I said it to my little corner.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.400
 - Let's check the number of impressions

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.400
 on that tweet later.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.000
 - Okay, yeah, let's do.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 So I felt something in a conversation with Casey last night

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.560
 that kept us up till 1.30.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.120
 And I'm gonna leave it at that.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.000
 But I will say, I don't feel a lot of things.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.880
 Do you feel like you have a lot of emotional depth?

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.280
 Do you feel like you don't strike me

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.120
 as like a super emotional guy?

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.360
 - I don't know, I wouldn't describe myself as emotional,

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.760
 but like I said, I am very dramatic

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.040
 and they're like very adjacent.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.840
 So I don't know, I don't know.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.880
 I think I am. - You're dramatic?

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.320
 - I think like, not emotionally dramatic though, right?

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.320
 Like I think you're dramatic in your like public presence

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.440
 and your like strategy or is that not what you mean?

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.280
 When you say dramatic.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.720
 - When I say dramatic, I just mean,

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.960
 I love to think about things in a very extreme way,

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.280
 almost like how it would play out in a movie

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.680
 with like good guys and bad guys and ups and downs

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.720
 and twists and turns and like and all that stuff.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.000
 So. - Yep, yep.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.360
 - And I think in general, I just like to think hard

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.320
 about everything.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.000
 So that includes stuff in that category as well.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.120
 So I wouldn't say I'm emotional,

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.560
 but I wouldn't say I'm like,

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.040
 like I thought I like avoid that part of life.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.080
 - Yeah, okay.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.320
 I don't avoid it.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.440
 It wasn't by choice.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.440
 I think there were things that shaped me.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.920
 And I'm not gonna really talk about it,

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.360
 but I think there are reasons

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.120
 I don't have a lot of emotional depth.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.960
 And then like there's little moments

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.360
 where I have very like strong,

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.400
 what I would call into probably normal emotions

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.920
 for other people, but like they feel very intense.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.760
 And it's like, oh, I actually have them.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.000
 I just literally shove them so deep

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.800
 that I don't feel them anymore.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.800
 - Mm.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.880
 - Wow, this has gotten really dark, I'm sorry.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:33.720
 - Isn't that dark?

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.160
 I mean, it sounds, it sounds normal.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.160
 I mean, I think- - I do say so.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.840
 - I always say so, Liz, that my approach with ending

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.000
 is just shove it deep down until it turns

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.600
 into like a hard ball or something

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.400
 that's just slowly gonna kill me at some point.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.800
 But you know, I can't feel it for now.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.280
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.880
 At least for the next few days, I'm good.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:53.800
 - Yeah.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.520
 I mean, you tease the hell out of literally everyone.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.360
 - What did I do?

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.720
 - Just you're like vaguely talking about this,

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.760
 all this stuff and you're not gonna reveal it.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.960
 You don't have to, but.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:03.920
 - Well, about what stuff?

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.320
 I'm not gonna reveal, oh, there are most of stuff

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.320
 I'm definitely not gonna talk about.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.160
 It's just like, it's not a thing I would talk about.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.680
 But I feel like I could talk about the,

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.960
 I mean, I've talked about how I'm a robot

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.560
 and I don't feel like I have a lot of feelings.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.680
 I gotta go back to the high thing

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.280
 because this is so funny to me

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.840
 that people think right now, okay,

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.960
 I'm gonna say some stuff.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.680
 And it's totally illegal, so it's fine.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.800
 I'm gonna say some stuff.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.640
 - Yeah.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.640
 - I do, I supplement with some THC CBD stuff

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.560
 on occasion, okay?

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.640
 I've had nothing today.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.480
 - Why, he's a first day.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.320
 - He's a first day.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.760
 - 'Cause my wife came in.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:40.600
 (laughing)

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.440
 She brought me some--

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.280
 - Is there a cop?

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.200
 (laughing)

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.920
 - She said, why'd you look over your shoulder?

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:46.760
 (laughing)

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:47.600
 Is there a cop?

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.240
 No, so I've been taking for a while,

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.240
 for like a few weeks.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.360
 Oh no, it all lines up.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.560
 So I've been taking some stuff that just calms me down.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.280
 It just makes me feel a little more like mellow.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.960
 Mostly around my kids, I'm pretty uptight, okay?

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.160
 You know this about me.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.760
 I'm a pretty uptight person.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.600
 (laughing)

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.120
 'Cause he's watching me, okay, this is so awkward.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.200
 So I'm a pretty uptight person.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.120
 I've been taking some stuff.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.400
 And today I haven't had any of it.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.600
 And now you guys think I'm high.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.520
 So it's just funny to me.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.480
 I've been high for like every conversation

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.360
 we've had for the last month.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.880
 And today I'm not, and you think I'm high.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:20.840
 I'm not been high.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:21.760
 I don't take that much.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.960
 It's just like a little bit.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.880
 It's just like, takes the edge off, you know?

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:26.720
 - I see.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.640
 - It makes me a better dad, okay?

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.920
 Like it literally makes me a better dad.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.160
 I know apologies.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.280
 - So you're doing it for the children?

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.680
 - I'm doing it for the children.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.480
 I literally take it at the end of my work day.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.760
 And like the rest of the evening,

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.240
 I'm just the coolest dad.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.080
 I'm not like--

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.000
 - What do you actually take?

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.840
 What is this?

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:43.680
 - Are we going there?

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.040
 We're going into, okay, specific products?

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.760
 - I'm just curious 'cause I would like to try.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.120
 - Yeah, no, yeah, okay.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.960
 You would like to try.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.280
 Maybe other listeners would like to try.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.120
 - Just the hell of it.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.240
 I'm done to try anything.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.920
 - It's legal in Missouri, okay?

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:55.760
 - It's legal?

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:56.600
 - It's legal.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.520
 Recreational.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.440
 Just whatever you want.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.000
 - Where do you know marijuana is legal in Missouri?

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.120
 - Marijuana is legal in Missouri, it is.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.520
 - That's so random to me.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.360
 - I know.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.120
 Yeah, Missouri, I thought it'd be like the last date,

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:07.880
 if I'm being honest.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.360
 But for whatever reason, we've had medical for a while

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.400
 and now, break graciously, in a way.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.000
 1906, they make these little tablets, I guess.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.120
 They're like a pilly swallow.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.000
 It's not like a, I don't smoke.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.240
 I'm not gonna like hit a bong.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.640
 I don't know, not that that's wrong.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.800
 I just like, I'm not a poulter kind of guy.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.240
 - I was imagining that it turns out this whole time,

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.440
 you're just doing bong rips after you get off stream.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.360
 - I don't know why, why is this so taboo?

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.320
 Why is it feel so weird to talk about?

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.160
 - It shouldn't.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.000
 - No, I don't think it is taboo.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.120
 - It's just a pluck, okay.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.720
 - Sorry, is that something you will say?

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.240
 (laughing)

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.360
 - You definitely sound high after saying that.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.120
 So you take these little tablets and you take one

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.240
 and then it's like, you barely feel it.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.960
 Like it's not like you're actively feeling too much.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.280
 - I don't, yeah, I don't feel like

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.680
 cognitively any different.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.480
 - Okay, that's a THC pill?

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.440
 - Yeah, it's a blend of, okay,

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.800
 so there's a bunch of different kinds.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.800
 They've got really good branding.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.640
 I'm a sucker for branding, okay?

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.320
 If something has really consistent packaging

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.160
 and branding and it's cool looking,

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.200
 I'm probably gonna wanna buy it, whatever it is.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.840
 - Yeah, I think this sounds from 1906,

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.320
 it sounds familiar.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.680
 - Yeah, it's like they make like chill,

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.000
 which is the one I take to be a good father.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.840
 (laughing)

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.360
 - Dude, there's one that's a genius for brain power.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.200
 - It doesn't work.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.520
 - You should take, you should take that part of it.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.520
 - Have you tried taking the whole bottle?

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.360
 - No, I've tried, yeah, yeah.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.160
 - I've tried all of them, yeah.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.160
 - Love for arousal.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.120
 - Okay, let's not talk about it.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.360
 (laughing)

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.040
 - What a podcast, okay.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.600
 - All right, wait, let me list out everything they have.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.600
 They've got go for energy, bliss for happiness,

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.240
 genius for brain power, love for arousal,

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.600
 chill for relaxation, midnight for sleep.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.880
 And you've said you've tried all of them.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.200
 They're all basically the same though.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.840
 - I can't find a couple of them in Missouri.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:07:59.800
 I'm not gonna say which two.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.000
 - Genius is illegal in Missouri.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.520
 It conflicts with the brand of Missouri.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.720
 (laughing)

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.400
 - I choked on Apple skin and I'm gonna die

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.880
 (laughing)

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:12.920
 on a podcast.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.640
 - Last episode, everyone.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.880
 - Yeah, maybe, I mean, maybe we might get canceled

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.200
 for something, I don't know.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.040
 (laughing)

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.720
 - I don't know, this has been okay to talk about

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.280
 for like years now.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.760
 - Not in the Ozark stacks, not in the Ozark.

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:26.600
 - That's true, okay.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.000
 - You just do math silently, you don't tell anybody.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.240
 (laughing)

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.480
 - Oh no, I feel like we need to take a step back.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.320
 - Okay.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.600
 - We've come in a little hot.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.560
 - This is this podcast episode is a little high energy.

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.800
 'Cause I don't have anything in my system.

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.000
 I've not had anything.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.680
 Like this is just natural atom.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.160
 This is how it used to be all the time.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.840
 Do you remember, did you notice a change?

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.440
 - I think so, I think I did.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.600
 But, okay.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.680
 - What was the messed up part though?

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:57.520
 - Yeah.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:58.920
 - You're not gonna like hearing this.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.320
 - I'm not gonna do it though.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.200
 - If you are asking me if I've noticed a change

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.360
 and I think about it, I'm like, yeah, I did notice a change.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.080
 But to me, it feels like you were just less excited

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:13.320
 about everything or like more lost, so.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.400
 - Yeah, okay.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.360
 I think that's what the effect mostly is.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:21.000
 I definitely felt less like it's a two-sided coin.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.280
 It's like driven, but also anxious.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.720
 I think they're like, they come together in a package

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.600
 that is great for like work and aspirations.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.520
 Like being that way, the way I feel right now.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:37.080
 I don't feel like I can have one without the other.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.240
 Like I can't be just my normal self.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:44.400
 I'm so high strong, I think is the word.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:48.000
 And I think it plays well in work.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.040
 I don't think it plays well in a family setting.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.760
 Not like anyone was complaining.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.240
 Like my family wasn't like, you're a horrible dad,

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.560
 you need to calm down.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:02.560
 But just, I don't like how like on edge and just like,

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.200
 I call it OCPD.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.960
 I don't even know if that's actually what it is,

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:09.480
 but like just every little thing that happens in life,

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.840
 I'm like attuned to it and I'm just, I'm jumping on.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:15.040
 And like, I can't just let them do stuff without,

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.120
 might not be safe, you know what I mean?

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.360
 Like hovering and doing all that stuff.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.760
 And I feel like with certain substances,

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.000
 I'm less like that.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.840
 I'm more just like, go with it.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.320
 Whatever's going on, who cares?

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.160
 - Interesting.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:31.160
 So when we were hanging out in Florida,

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.840
 I noticed a situation that thought was really interesting

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:38.120
 where, so your younger one was like sitting like--

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:38.960
 - Archer.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:43.280
 - Yeah, he was sitting at the edge of the chair

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.800
 and he kind of slipped.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.240
 And he like almost smashed his face onto the table,

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.720
 but he caught himself.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:53.160
 And Casey had like a crazy reaction.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.840
 Obviously me too, I was like, oh my God.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.680
 But then she like little covered her mouth

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.680
 and like made herself not react.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.200
 And I was like, oh, that must be,

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.680
 that must be a very intentional thing.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.920
 'Cause if you freak out,

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.880
 'cause I think most of the way his parents would freak out,

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.840
 they'd be like, oh my God, you gotta be careful, whatever.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.040
 But then the kid kind of like,

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.080
 that's like bad long term for the kid.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.600
 So she, I watched her like react

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.680
 but then like stifle it very quickly.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.440
 - She is so, she is my opposite.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.520
 She is so good at it.

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:23.520
 She's so good at just letting them live life and like,

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.680
 and teaching them things and having them do things

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.440
 that I just don't even think kids are capable of.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:32.160
 I treat them like little tiny, something else, not human.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.360
 And she just like views them as little adults

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.800
 that are tiny and haven't learned everything.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.080
 And like they cook food, they do all kinds of stuff.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.320
 And when I'm with them, it's like,

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.480
 I'm just way too extra, I don't know.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.560
 Like I am right now at this very moment.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:48.160
 I'd forgotten what it feels like.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.760
 - So why did you stop?

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.920
 Or like randomly you stopped or was it intentional?

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.080
 - I know, it was just staying up late.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.640
 So I've still got Apple in my,

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.400
 I shouldn't eat while I'm doing a podcast.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.240
 Like we stayed up late, we woke up late.

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.520
 I've been with the boys.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.600
 I was late to come in here and record.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.800
 And I just haven't like, I haven't consumed anything.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:07.640
 So I wasn't planning on not.

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.160
 It's just kind of how things worked out.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.120
 But maybe this is better.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.600
 Maybe you liked the old me.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.880
 Maybe you fell in love with the Adam of old.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.880
 You said, I mean, I just saw you on Twitch.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.320
 You said, you don't think I've coded for five weeks.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.880
 I have, I've just not been doing anything publicly

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.800
 for other things that are going on, other reasons.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.080
 Am I publicly melting down?

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.160
 Is this a public meltdown?

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.440
 Ooh, would that be cool?

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:30.280
 If I did?

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.680
 - That'd be cool.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.280
 It might be good for our numbers, I don't know.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:34.240
 - Maybe, yeah.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.880
 - I mean, that thread that you have go in definitely is not,

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.040
 that definitely seems like a precursor

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.520
 to public meltdown for sure.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:42.520
 - Oh really?

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.000
 That seems to melt downy?

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:44.920
 Oh no.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.640
 - No, it may seem like jokingly, but it is funny.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:49.640
 Like you're just talking to yourself,

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.560
 but I'm just like, what the hell is he doing?

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:52.400
 - Oh no.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:58.080
 Well, 'cause honestly, like I love being able to tweet a bunch,

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.320
 but I would never just like tweet those things.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.480
 - To your main feed, yeah.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.520
 - Out into the ether.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.520
 Yeah, but like doing it on that thread

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:06.720
 when I know like a hundred people will see it,

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.480
 it's just like, what are the thoughts in my head?

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.880
 I'm gonna dump them here and I don't care.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:11.840
 So it's been nice.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:15.800
 - What's funny is because I am somewhere up in that thread,

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.520
 I get notified for every single one.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.160
 So I see every single one.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.480
 - You gotta mute 'em, facts.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.360
 - But I wanna see, I wanna see your public meltdown.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.600
 (laughing)

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:28.320
 - I see them and I just get the urge to be really mean.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.920
 I just get the urge to reply being like, shut the fuck up.

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:32.840
 - Yeah, I mean, it's not just urges.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.560
 You've definitely said something.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:37.280
 (laughing)

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:38.400
 - Well, it seems like people like it.

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.480
 The people like it.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.880
 - It's like the same little crew that's here in Twitch.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:42.720
 It's our friends.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:43.560
 - I mean, have you made the Twitter,

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.680
 have you done the Twitter circle thing?

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.440
 - Oh, I did that a long time ago.

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.040
 I forgot, I totally forgot.

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:49.880
 Yeah, no, I have one.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.200
 I don't know who's in it.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.960
 I think I tweeted one time to my circle.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.320
 Circles actually make a ton of sense.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:00.720
 I never thought like the idea that when I see someone tweet

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.880
 and it has the little green thing

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.200
 that like, this is in the circle.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.960
 I wanna respond 'cause I want everyone to know

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:05.800
 I'm in their circle.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:06.640
 You know what I mean?

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.560
 So it's like, it's just immediate engagement bait.

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.520
 Do you feel that way?

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:12.880
 Am I exposing something that's--

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.160
 - It definitely feels like special

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.200
 'cause I'm seeing it and not everyone's seeing it.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.320
 So it feels like, oh, this person, you know,

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:22.200
 considers me someone they wanna take it to the next level.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.680
 - But you don't think like, oh, I gotta make sure everyone

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.160
 in the circle knows I'm in the circle.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.960
 You don't think that?

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:28.880
 And reply.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:29.720
 - Oh, like you--

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.400
 (laughing)

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.800
 - You gotta represent.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:33.800
 - That's really funny.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.760
 No, I don't think I've ever had that thought.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:36.920
 - Okay, I'm terrible.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.120
 I'm a bad human being, I'm sorry.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.200
 - No, you're not.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.840
 - You're just meaty.

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:41.680
 - I'm meaty.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:45.280
 It's weird to feel this way.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:46.640
 - Like yourself?

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.720
 - Yeah, like myself.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.560
 - It's been one month?

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.080
 - Natural Adam.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.880
 Probably, yeah.

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.320
 Yeah, I think it, the Florida trip.

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.560
 What did you do to me, Dax?

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.000
 What did you do when we met in Florida?

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.120
 - I didn't do anything.

00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:58.960
 What did I do?

00:14:58.960 --> 00:14:59.800
 - What did you do?

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.800
 - I think the sunburn changed you.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.160
 - Maybe.

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.640
 - It changed you, like, in your cellular level,

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.880
 it just changed you, the radiation.

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.680
 - I actually had stuff I wanted to talk about today.

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:11.880
 And then you were like, let's just go ahead

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.440
 and hit record and this is gonna be bad, but--

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.280
 - No, this is good.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:18.360
 - I think talking about the mass amounts of drugs you do

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.200
 to just to--

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.040
 - Oh my God.

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:24.240
 - Just to tolerate life is gonna be very, very interesting.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.040
 - Here's the thing, okay, this is what I wanna talk about,

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.840
 actually, it's not what I came in when I talk about,

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.960
 but now it's what I wanna talk about.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:30.360
 - Yeah.

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.600
 - Our society sucks.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.520
 Like, it's just so dumb.

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:35.680
 - Okay, you need to get more specific.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:36.520
 - I'm going to.

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:38.320
 I'm going to, I just gotta finish chewing this piece of apple.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.720
 - How much apple do you have?

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.920
 - Two whole pink lady apples, am I annoying you?

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.320
 - That's so many more apples places.

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.680
 - Yeah, it's a lot.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.040
 I haven't eaten anything yet, Dex.

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.440
 This is also hungry.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.280
 - I'm gonna take some time to eat it.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:52.720
 - Like, you wanna pause the podcast?

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:53.560
 - And keep recording.

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:54.640
 - Is my chewing bothering you?

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.200
 - No, I mean, I was bothering you,

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.680
 like, 'cause I feel like you're stopping to eat

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.360
 and you're not finishing your sentence.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.040
 - I just thought it added to the storytelling.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:01.960
 Like, you know--

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.720
 - Oh, I mean, if you're fine with it, I'm fine with it.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.000
 - Oh, I'm fine with it, if you're fine with it,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:05.840
 I'm fine with it.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:06.680
 - I am fine with it.

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.400
 - Do you wanna check with Zuko or Liz

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.240
 if they're fine with it?

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.320
 (laughing)

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.320
 Maybe it's gonna be your thing

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.580
 or you're always just gonna be eating something on the podcast.

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:15.880
 - And that Ocean's 11 movie.

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.320
 Like, every scene that Brad Pitt was in,

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.320
 he was like eating something.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.360
 - Yeah, he's always eating that one.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.520
 Did you know that he's from Springfield?

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:21.760
 That's where I'm from.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:23.600
 Me and Brad Pitt, we got that in common.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.320
 Okay, so here's why our society sucks.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.080
 And I'm not gonna speak, like,

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:31.800
 we're very connected now to an international group of people.

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:33.760
 Half the people we hang out with online

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.520
 are probably not from the US.

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:39.400
 So I'm not gonna speak to, like, society universally,

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.200
 specifically in the US.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.320
 'Cause it's all I know.

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.560
 It might apply to other places,

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.920
 but it's so dumb and broken.

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:49.480
 And there are so many things, okay,

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:52.720
 so like, we live in a neighborhood.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.720
 And in this neighborhood,

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.400
 I would never tell a single neighbor

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.320
 that I've consumed THE.

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.640
 I wouldn't tell him I've consumed anything

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.960
 unless it's coffee or,

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.400
 I wouldn't even tell him I've consumed alcohol

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.880
 because it's just like,

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.400
 there's just like this very dumb fake thing

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.800
 about our society.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.160
 Oh, this sounds like a mental breakdown.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.120
 It really does.

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:14.120
 I'm not having a mental breakdown, I promise.

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:16.520
 I've never felt better about life.

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:18.240
 Oh, this is what somebody was having.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.080
 - I'm not gonna say anything,

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:21.040
 I'm just gonna keep letting you talk.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.160
 - That's making it harder for me

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.080
 'cause I feel like you really think I'm breaking down.

00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:25.400
 I'm not breaking down.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.800
 I just think there's a lot of fake stuff.

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.800
 We water our lawns, we cut our lawns.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.080
 Like, why?

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.120
 This is very specific.

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.280
 But like, if you really think about,

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.680
 why do we have grass?

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:40.640
 It's a picture of why I think this whole thing,

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.600
 the whole society is fundamentally broken.

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.200
 - Okay, so I think this touches on something that,

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.520
 we maybe have talked about before,

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.600
 but this is one of Liz's insights.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.880
 I'm gonna steal yet again,

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.360
 I need another podcast episode.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:57.520
 But she talks about how we have to decide

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.160
 every little detail.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.200
 Like, what kind of house do we live in?

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.760
 What kind of food do we eat?

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:04.440
 What's our marriage ceremony gonna look like?

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.400
 Every little detail in America specifically,

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:11.960
 because we don't have like an ancient universal culture

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.800
 that just kind of automatically tells us,

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.200
 this is what you do.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.160
 And it's good to have a lot of choice,

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.320
 but for some things, it's like kind of overwhelming.

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.920
 That said, I do see this grass thing

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.440
 as kind of in that category.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.520
 It's just like the default

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.400
 so that most people don't have to think too hard about it.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.320
 Right?

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:32.800
 'Cause I don't know if everyone wants to really figure out

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:35.600
 from scratch, like what kind of yard am I gonna have?

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.480
 Yeah, okay, I see what you're saying.

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:42.200
 So like, it's harder to have like a natural landscape.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.960
 An alternative lawn is more work.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:45.960
 Well, no, it's not more work.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.160
 It's more thinking.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.320
 Exactly, it's more thinking.

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.000
 And there's like, you're already like deciding

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.680
 in a million places like what,

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.640
 I think people to different spectrums

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:58.880
 like or want to be intentional about their life.

00:18:58.880 --> 00:18:59.800
 But I think for a lot of people

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.000
 they're really honest with themselves,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.920
 like they would actually just kind of want,

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:06.280
 like, we're just gonna do this

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:07.560
 'cause we've always done this.

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.920
 But like a large portion of it.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.080
 And you can see that with the lawns and the yards

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:13.280
 and what people's houses look like.

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.480
 And it does reflect the reality

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.880
 that people just kind of want things to be decent

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.080
 without them to think too hard about it.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:20.720
 It's not having to think too hard about

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.560
 like just having less decisions in life.

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.360
 Okay, I guess I get it.

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:26.720
 But it's a pretty expensive thing

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.160
 to like, like not from like a money sample.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.880
 And just like we're dumping water

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.960
 on these stupid grass lawns and then cutting them.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.880
 Like it's just a very,

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.400
 like it feels like we could have had a better default.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.240
 I don't know.

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:38.240
 Like we have a lot next,

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.320
 we own a lot next door

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:41.880
 that I would love for you to build a house on.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.080
 By the way, Dax, if you ever wanna head up to those arts.

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.000
 Okay, maybe.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.600
 Okay, okay, baby.

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:50.920
 That lot has like all of this amazing, natural,

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.760
 like local vegetation on it

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.240
 that the butterflies love,

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.520
 that there's so many things flying around on it.

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.360
 It looks so cool to me.

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.160
 And it wants to be there.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.240
 You don't have to water it.

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.600
 It just wants to grow there, right?

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:04.440
 - Yeah.

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.840
 - Why can't we just have that all around our houses?

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:10.440
 I'm sorry, I'm getting way too into the grass thing.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.760
 - No, I mean, that's a,

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:12.720
 I don't know the answer.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.560
 I'm just not well educated on this.

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:16.480
 So, and it's funny.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.600
 I was making fun of me in the chat

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.120
 because I don't, I have fake grass, right?

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.800
 'Cause my, again, - You have fake grass?

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:26.680
 - I need to, I need to qualify this for everyone listening.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:29.400
 I did not choose to put in fake grass.

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:33.560
 So my front and backyard entirely covered in turf grass.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:36.720
 Not like sports turf, so it's not like grainy.

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.200
 It's just like, but guess what?

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.280
 I just need to be watered at him.

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.600
 So, - I mean, that's true.

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:43.720
 That's better than what I have.

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:46.240
 - So it, so I thought I would hate it

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:49.120
 'cause it looks like it's just so not natural,

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.560
 but it's always clean.

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:52.880
 We can always just lie down in it.

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:53.800
 And it's always just like,

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:57.680
 it kind of feels like my, my house is like three times as big

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:00.760
 'cause I can just kind of like do whatever I want there.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.320
 So to the dog, like he like pees on it and poops on stuff,

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:06.560
 but it's not killing patches and the garden and everything.

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:09.560
 - Okay, but I guess it drains, like normal grass.

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:10.920
 - I don't know if it would just keep it.

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.360
 Like if we buy this house,

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.400
 I don't know if I would keep the fake grass,

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.720
 but I will say it's, it's,

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.240
 I thought it would just overall suck,

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.520
 but it is kind of like kind of interesting.

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:26.520
 It's kind of like you have like a little like play area

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:27.640
 where you can just kind of do whatever

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.480
 and it's always clean and there's no dirt.

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:32.800
 - I mean, I, yeah, I'm as someone who doesn't like dirt

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:35.720
 and most things outside, I see the appeal,

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:38.540
 but it just feels like it's exactly my point

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:41.480
 that like most of American society is fake

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.680
 and it drives me nuts.

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.520
 You're putting a very positive spin on it.

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.040
 So I guess I'm feeling a little bad,

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:49.160
 like I'm coming in with conspiracy theories here

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:51.080
 and you're like, actually it's just nice

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.480
 to not think about these things.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.560
 - No, well, okay, but I'll like challenge you

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:55.520
 in a few other ways, right?

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:58.960
 So ignoring the grass part,

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.120
 if you look at all the trees in my house,

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:01.960
 people love it.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.560
 Like it's like, wow, like it looks really good,

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:05.400
 so natural.

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.000
 We have all kinds of different trees

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.320
 that are like really overgrown,

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:09.720
 like really covering everything.

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.040
 It looks very natural.

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:13.400
 100% of the trees from Asia,

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.200
 not Florida trees at all.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:20.200
 Every single tree in my yard is from Asia.

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.560
 So in a lot of ways, you can say that's not natural.

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:23.400
 - So are you.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.240
 I mean.

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.100
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:27.800
 (both laughing)

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:29.600
 Yeah, everyone will look at them and say,

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.840
 oh, that's like a very natural yard besides a fake grass.

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:33.680
 - Yeah.

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.480
 - But it's not really, it's like very curated

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:39.880
 and intentional and everyone in my whole neighborhood,

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.160
 it's like, there's tons of trees everywhere,

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.400
 like extremely overgrown, like treated like blanketing,

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.680
 like over the streets and it's really,

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:50.920
 it's why I moved there 'cause it's such a nice, nice feeling

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.360
 and we feel like we're living in such harmony with everything.

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.840
 But technically, I don't know if any of those trees

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:55.840
 are actually native to Florida

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:59.480
 'cause Florida native stuff is like, it can look cool,

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.800
 but just not as cool as like the Asian stuff.

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:05.440
 - Does that bolster your point or mine?

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.840
 - I think it's, I think the idea is like,

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.480
 there's like the appeal to nature fallacy,

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:14.520
 which is like anything that is natural is good

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:16.400
 and it's not natural, it's bad,

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.960
 but there's a question of like, what actually is natural.

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.960
 You guys have a bunch of invasive stuff you were talking about.

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.400
 I'm sure you guys have invasive trees

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.040
 that you're dealing with and stuff like that.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.280
 - Oh yeah, sure, yeah.

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.240
 - That technically is natural, but also not natural

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.520
 'cause humans introduced it.

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.440
 I don't know, at this point it's hard to say what's what,

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:35.760
 but I do agree with, yeah, like lawns are kind of ugly to me,

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.160
 just like from a purely aesthetic thing,

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:41.480
 like a flat lawn is just not super interesting.

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:44.840
 - So much less interesting than like any other ground cover,

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:45.680
 really.

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.520
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:49.240
 And even if we dig it along like Liz has this very specific,

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:51.240
 again, it's all about like being intentional.

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:55.000
 She's really into the specific grass that grows in Cuba

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.960
 and like that's the type of lawn she would have.

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.640
 And it doesn't look like a typical American lawn,

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.280
 it's like a little bit more wild.

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:01.120
 - Yeah.

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:02.240
 - But again, like, you know, she's picking that

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.440
 'cause she like was born there and just familiar with it

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:05.640
 and just kind of default there

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.680
 and she'd like to have the default here.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:08.520
 - Yeah.

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:09.880
 - But again, I don't know why everyone has lawns.

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.880
 I don't know if people genuinely like them or not.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.600
 - Okay, I've made a mistake

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:18.320
 and I've made this conversation about literally about lawns

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:19.760
 and I didn't mean to.

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.200
 Do you feel like how much of your time

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:26.200
 do you feel like you spend just being a fake like facade

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:28.840
 of a human being interacting with people?

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:30.480
 None zero?

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.760
 Do you ever interact with people in person that you don't know?

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:33.600
 - All the time.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.720
 Okay, so none is an overstatement.

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:40.920
 As my life has gone on, it's gotten close to zero,

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:41.760
 but it's not out of zero.

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:42.600
 - I guess me too.

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:45.040
 - Because of the internet, like we can be connected

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.720
 to people we actually can be ourselves with on the internet.

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.160
 - Well, that's not really my problem.

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.000
 That's your problem.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:50.840
 - Oh, yeah, me neither.

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:51.680
 - No, no, no, no, no.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.000
 - Not me either.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.640
 (laughing)

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:55.680
 - I'm saying you live in the Ozarks.

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:56.800
 You might not have a lot of people around you

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:59.640
 that are relatable, but I live in a place where,

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:00.640
 yeah, I live in a place where--

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.480
 - I keep talking over you now.

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:02.800
 I kind of just want to keep doing it.

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:03.640
 Sorry.

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:04.480
 (laughing)

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.320
 I'm just going to shut up.

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.320
 Chris is going to hate this so much.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:08.640
 - I live in a place where,

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.160
 I still live like kind of a weird way,

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:12.880
 so I don't like fully relate to most people,

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.400
 but it's at least, I don't know,

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:18.080
 it's not like, it's some spectrum, right?

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:19.880
 And I get closer to people and I can be more myself.

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.320
 So, but do you feel like around you,

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:25.640
 you're like, very constrained?

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.880
 - Yeah, maybe this is not a American problem.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.840
 Maybe this is more Midwest problem.

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:32.000
 I feel like a lot of the things I'm railing on

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.200
 are probably more pervasive in the Midwest or even lawns.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:40.760
 Like you live in a city, you don't have that realization

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:43.320
 that we're all just like watering our stupid grass.

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:45.040
 I don't know, yeah, it feels very fake here.

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.280
 Yeah, I don't know, that's dumb.

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:47.800
 I don't even want to say that.

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.040
 It's not that it's fake here.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:49.940
 Everyone wants to be like,

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:52.120
 "Oh, I live in a terrible place with the worst

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:53.360
 and everyone sucks."

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:54.600
 That's not, it's not true.

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.400
 Like it's a great, it's whatever.

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.320
 I have nothing to say.

00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:58.160
 I don't know.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.200
 - Well, you've started by saying your society

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:01.760
 is terrible and broken.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:02.600
 Like what--

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.960
 - I think, yeah, I think that's more a reflection

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:08.400
 of how I'm feeling right now than actual society.

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.240
 - But is that like--

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.080
 - We've got full circle.

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:11.520
 - You gave one example of lawns

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.400
 and I see I can like extract the point,

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.120
 I can like tie those together in some way.

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:16.840
 - Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah.

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:18.120
 Okay, there's a bigger point.

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:20.280
 This is the thing I actually want to come in talking about,

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.880
 which is, and this is again,

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.640
 probably more of a Midwest thing,

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.040
 a little more socially conservative.

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:27.920
 And I'm not gonna like get into,

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:30.840
 I'm not gonna say a lot of things I would say.

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:32.120
 If, why wouldn't I though?

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.480
 Why wouldn't I just say what I want to say?

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.760
 'Cause I don't know who listens to this.

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.600
 And I don't want, people just get so offended anyway.

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.800
 But is that a thing you can say

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.240
 that people get offended, is that like,

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.240
 am I aligning with some certain group of people

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.800
 by being like, everyone gets offended?

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:44.960
 'Cause I don't really actually believe that.

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:47.400
 I just think like, I don't want people to feel bad.

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.760
 So I'm not gonna say things I think will make people feel bad.

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:53.560
 But, all that said, do you regret doing this podcast

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:54.400
 with me that quick?

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:55.560
 I mean, not today.

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:58.120
 I mean like, there's no 30 episodes we've been.

00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:59.560
 I gotta fish for thought.

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:01.200
 I don't think anything.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:05.160
 So here's the thing, in this area, in particular,

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.040
 it's a lot of like, monoculture,

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:09.440
 the same household story,

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:14.000
 where the mom takes care of your kids,

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 the dad goes to work, and then everyone's unhappy.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.560
 Because the mom never signed up to just like,

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:26.200
 do everything for everyone at all times.

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.040
 That's not how she envisioned her life.

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:29.680
 And this is not, okay, I'm not talking about my wife.

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:32.160
 I'm just saying like, generally speaking,

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.280
 like we went to Target yesterday,

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:36.680
 and just my wife and I, on a date.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.280
 'Cause we didn't even go on Target.

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:39.120
 We were in the parking lot.

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.800
 We literally just wanna be alone in the car.

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.520
 And so we ended up in the parking lot at Target.

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.200
 I got to watch a lot of cars come in.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.680
 All women in SUVs, presumably mothers,

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.360
 their kids are at school or whatever.

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:51.880
 And we're all unhappy.

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:52.720
 Everyone hates it.

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:55.040
 And everyone just acts like this is fine.

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.560
 And especially in this area,

00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:01.560
 there are like certain societal forces and belief systems

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:05.680
 that sort of reinforce this is how things should be.

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.280
 But there's not enough help.

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:08.120
 We don't have enough help.

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:11.160
 People raising families, just generally speaking in the US,

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.360
 we all pretend like we should all just go to work

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:15.360
 and be productive and like, whatever.

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:20.400
 But like families, specifically like young families

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.560
 with young children, there's just not enough help.

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:25.600
 And it's not the way people raise kids 200 years ago.

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:26.720
 I'm just sure of it.

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.080
 And it feels very unnatural.

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:30.280
 It feels like most people are struggling

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:34.160
 with mental health parents with young children.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.200
 And we all just kind of like accept it.

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.960
 And this is how things should be.

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:40.560
 And I don't know, it just sucks.

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.840
 - Yeah, no, I definitely hear that.

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:46.600
 And I think for me, I always try to blend in like,

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.360
 okay, we live in a modern time

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:50.480
 and that we're fortunate in a lot of ways

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:53.040
 or we're free to choose a lot of things.

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:56.120
 But I also don't wanna like toss away like stuff

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:58.680
 that has worked for a long time.

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:00.600
 It's like, it's interesting to blend those together.

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:02.320
 I think you said about people didn't raise kids like this.

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:05.000
 Yeah, because you used to have like intergenerational

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.400
 households where like the grandparents lived

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.520
 with the parents and lived with the kids.

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:13.560
 And it's like, there's like four adults per kid.

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:15.680
 And it's like a very different type of situation.

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:16.520
 - Very different.

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.680
 - Yeah, so a lot of our friends kind of went

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.160
 through the same thing where they,

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:24.640
 when we lived in New York, they all had kids there,

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:27.440
 like thousands of miles away from any family member,

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:29.240
 also like in like New York City,

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:31.920
 which is one of the hardest places to live in the country

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.120
 in terms of like everything being inconvenient.

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:36.440
 And it was just so, so, so, so hard.

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:40.480
 And it felt like that like we saw that

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:41.440
 and we were like, there's no way.

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.160
 Like having kids seems hard on its own.

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:44.800
 And then like then adding the additional layer

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:47.540
 of doing it entirely alone in like a big city.

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:50.240
 So that's why it's one of the big reasons we moved.

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.140
 You know, we wanted to have kids.

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:53.560
 We wanted like a more traditional setup.

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:57.080
 And I think it's a little bit easier for us

00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:00.720
 because culturally neither me or Liz

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:03.040
 or in a culture that has moved just super far away

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:04.520
 from the traditional way of living.

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:07.560
 - You still have that close family thing going on.

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.640
 - Yeah, it's not like everyone lives, literally lives

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:11.880
 together, but it's like everyone kind of has.

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:12.720
 - They support each other.

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.800
 - Yeah, it's like everyone lives really close.

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:17.600
 And everyone has like an extra room

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:20.080
 that some family members are like temporarily staying

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:20.880
 in for six months.

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:24.840
 So it's just always like, it's like a very different thing.

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:26.520
 And everyone's like very well supported.

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:27.720
 And we'll see how it actually plays out

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:29.640
 when we have kids like they're obviously our changes

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:34.080
 with our generation, but yeah, like doing all that alone

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:37.280
 just seems impossible while also like having

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:39.280
 like ambitious careers for both me and Liz.

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:42.880
 Yeah, I don't know how people help people do it.

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.880
 I don't really know why people are choosing that.

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.000
 Do they not realize or they explicitly like

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.680
 trying to get away from their family?

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:49.520
 - Yeah, I don't know.

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:52.360
 Like I feel like the way things are set up,

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:55.440
 it didn't feel like we chose this path,

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.560
 but you just kind of by default end up in this situation

00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:58.600
 where you feel very alone.

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:01.400
 Like you feel like you're kind of on your own.

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.200
 And I know some people have their parents right next door

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:05.040
 and my parents are moving next door.

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:06.080
 Like they're building a house

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.160
 and we'll be moving in in the next few months.

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.240
 That'll help.

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.480
 I feel like we should have had that for the last eight years.

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:14.960
 Like just not having, I think a lot of people make it

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:16.160
 because they send their kids to school.

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:19.680
 We just, we've chosen the hard path for like everything

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:22.720
 in life and it's very hard to like justify

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:25.960
 making it easier on ourselves to then,

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:27.800
 I don't know, I'll never send my kid to public school.

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:28.960
 That's a very privileged thing to say,

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:30.160
 but like I'm just not gonna do it.

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:33.160
 I went to public school and it turned out fine, but like,

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:35.720
 okay, I'm coming off of it.

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:38.200
 I might need to take some THG or something.

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:39.120
 - It's all too much.

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:40.280
 - It's just too much.

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:43.280
 - I wanna see if you're often for like a week,

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:44.360
 like where do you end up?

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:46.080
 - I mean, this is how I used to be.

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.880
 This is the atom that you got to know.

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:50.800
 - But maybe there's like an effect

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:53.720
 where it's gonna go even crazier

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:55.840
 'cause you had it like some dude for a month, you know?

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:59.080
 - Maybe, I do feel more on edge than I did before

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:02.240
 because it's like coming off of it.

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:05.400
 I think this is how probably I used to feel all the time.

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.640
 I'm sorry, this episode went a lot of different places.

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:10.680
 I feel like not in a good way.

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:13.440
 - The thing I always say about where I live,

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.840
 the city is that I just like the tension

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:17.480
 between the two extremes.

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:19.240
 It's not just one extreme.

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:21.520
 It's like both extremes, I think are dumb,

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:23.960
 but there's tension, there's like enough tension

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:28.440
 on both sides that we land somewhere, like not entirely stupid.

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.040
 So yeah, I found that that's pretty good.

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:31.200
 Like most days I've been in,

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.440
 I've been like way too extreme on one side.

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:37.920
 We have a, you know how that's always people that are like,

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:41.520
 if this person gets elected, I'm gonna leave America.

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:44.720
 So we have, so my friend has like a family friend

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.120
 as his dad's friend.

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:48.640
 His dad's friend was like, if Obama gets elected,

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.080
 I'm gonna leave the country.

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.480
 Now, Obama got elected and he literally left

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:54.840
 at the door or like Panama or something.

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.040
 And he just, he just been there.

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:59.520
 And like somehow, he's like been very successful.

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:01.240
 Like he opens up some business or something.

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:04.000
 He's like very rich there and he's completely fine.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.280
 So he did the one person that literally left

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:08.120
 'cause someone got elected.

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:08.960
 - That's awesome.

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:12.000
 Yeah, so many has put that like success story out there

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.360
 so that people, it's always the people come out

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.080
 and like we're leaving and then the people come out

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:18.720
 like go go leave and then the people are like,

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:19.960
 you're not actually leaving.

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:22.200
 Now we have actual case of someone left

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:23.800
 when you need to put it on the wall.

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:24.800
 It's just so dumb.

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:29.180
 It's just the, there's no logic like this podcast episode.

00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:32.080
 There's no, there's no mellow, you've been the mellow.

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:34.840
 You've been helping keep this together, Dax.

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:36.640
 I appreciate you, thank you.

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:38.720
 - And look, I don't even need the THC.

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:39.720
 - You didn't even need the THC.

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.320
 You're just naturally like this, huh?

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:42.160
 - I don't know.

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:43.000
 I don't know.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.880
 With all this stuff, it's just like, it's so complicated.

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:46.720
 Like America's so different than any other country.

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:49.720
 It's like, I don't think anyone really knows,

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.640
 I don't know what to do about any of it.

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:54.520
 Like it doesn't, I'm just trying to find out what it exists.

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:55.720
 - I feel like you probably,

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:57.960
 you're very like measured about everything.

00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:59.600
 I feel like you probably disagree with me really hard

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:02.000
 right now and you're just, you think I'm fragile

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.320
 in this current state and you're not saying the things

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:05.880
 you wanna say, tell me what you really think.

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:08.920
 Like, am I going all anti-American and like dumb?

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:09.760
 Should I stop?

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:11.600
 - I don't think you're fragile.

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:14.720
 I understand these things when they show up.

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:19.280
 It's like really scary and it like really gets in your head

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:20.320
 and it gets in my head too.

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.000
 And like there'll be days where I think about it

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.800
 and I like freak out, but that is real.

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.440
 And I think we need to figure something out.

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.640
 I don't know what it is.

00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:31.920
 I'm sure we can be doing more than we're currently doing.

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:34.240
 I'm sure there's a lot of like corrupt forces

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:37.960
 that like prevent things from going to a more measured place.

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:41.160
 Simultaneously, there's just like, I don't know.

00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:43.080
 There just is like a history and a culture

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:45.800
 and like that we have in America.

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:48.000
 It's like pretty different from everywhere else.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.160
 Like with everything, it just comes down to like

00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:52.640
 some people, there's like a list of things to care about.

00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:54.320
 And for some people, the thing that they will never

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.920
 compromise on is global warming.

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:56.920
 I think it's other people.

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:59.480
 It's like civil rights for other people.

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:03.520
 It's like they'll drop everything before they drop, you know,

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:04.600
 having their guns, et cetera.

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:05.440
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:06.920
 - So yeah, I don't really know.

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:09.080
 I just, we live in like a really extremely diverse,

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:09.920
 complex world.

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:13.880
 I just try to fall back to I want the laws in my city

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:15.360
 to reflect myself.

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.200
 I don't give a shit what's going on in Missouri.

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.600
 I don't give a shit what's happening on California.

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.360
 - Yeah, it's hard for me 'cause I can't live in Florida.

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:23.360
 So which can be more extreme than I want.

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:26.440
 But like I said, in Miami, the tension on both sides is good.

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:28.760
 - Maybe we should just record all day, Dax.

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.520
 Maybe we should just not stop this episode.

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:32.800
 I feel like maybe eventually we'll get somewhere.

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:36.160
 - Look on your face, you were like.

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.920
 - No, I actually thought it was a good idea.

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:39.720
 I don't know how it came across, but I was like.

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:42.080
 - It came across as like, I was thinking about

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:44.160
 how much editing work it is.

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:45.600
 It's like we record for seven hours

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.240
 and reduce it down to 30 minutes.

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:49.480
 - This episode really could just be the grass episode

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.000
 because we started talking about THC.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.760
 Then we talked about lawns.

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:53.600
 It's grass.

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:54.440
 You see that?

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:55.600
 Yeah? - Nice.

00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:56.440
 Wow. - I know it's,

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:57.280
 I don't know how that works.

00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:58.680
 It almost seems like we plan it sometimes,

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:00.480
 but we really don't.

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.040
 - Definitely do not plan it.

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:03.160
 - Everything's very complicated.

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:07.080
 And it's very hard to not get into a polarized position.

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:10.000
 I feel like I get polarized on everything I think about

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.200
 for more than 10 seconds.

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:12.360
 Maybe that's my personality.

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:13.920
 Maybe that's not everybody's problem.

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:14.760
 But I don't know.

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:15.600
 I look around the internet.

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:16.440
 It seems like it's everybody's problem.

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:19.400
 - No, that's largely like the default state, yeah.

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:20.680
 - But why do you seem so measured?

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:22.640
 Why do I just, I feel like a maniac right now,

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:23.960
 the way I'm coming off compared to you.

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:26.520
 When I listen to you talk and I listen to myself,

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.960
 I'm like, what's wrong?

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:30.120
 Why am I broken?

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:30.960
 - I don't know.

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:35.240
 I think it's like, I don't even, I can't, I don't know.

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:37.160
 I don't know.

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:39.120
 I think I get enjoying, I get like the thing

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:42.240
 that overpowers everything is I like really feeling like

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:45.980
 I have landed in a good place.

00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:48.040
 And that's kind of what like.

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:49.400
 Like you've landed in a good place.

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:50.240
 Could you explain that to me?

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:53.640
 - Like with every topic, I'm like, okay, like,

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:56.800
 I feel like I'm my perspective on it

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:59.640
 and I like wear like landed on how I think about it.

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:02.640
 It's like, you know, it's like not crazy is good.

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.200
 Like I get it, I'm not afraid of it.

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:08.240
 Like I, you know, I never wanna feel like I'm like too extreme.

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:09.080
 - Yeah.

00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:10.760
 - And that kind of overpowers everything.

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:11.600
 I don't know.

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:12.440
 - I don't know.

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:13.280
 I don't know.

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:14.160
 I don't know, Dex.

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:15.000
 I don't know.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.600
 - All right, next topic, immigration.

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:17.680
 - Immigration, let's go.

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:18.800
 I don't know anything about immigration.

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:20.080
 Tell me, what do you know?

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:21.640
 We're not actually, you're joking, right?

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:23.640
 - Well, I actually do have thoughts on it.

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:24.480
 - Please do.

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.680
 We might as well get them all out in one.

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:27.040
 Let's just, this is the purge.

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:29.280
 This is the purge of like all political takes.

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:31.120
 All takes that we kind of just wanna get out there

00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:32.680
 in the world and like, we can't be judged

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:33.800
 'cause it's the purge.

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:37.040
 - So this is a one topic that draws out a good amount

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:40.200
 of like, not passion, but I would say this is one thing

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:43.080
 where I'm just like, I feel like it's not a frustration with.

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:44.560
 - Ooh, are you gonna like grab your microphone

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:45.400
 like I did earlier?

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:47.440
 You can get that upset.

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:48.280
 - Please do.

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:49.700
 - I don't know if I'll go that far, but.

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:50.680
 - Now let's list out here.

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:52.760
 - Okay, here's how I feel.

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:55.720
 We live in a very, very competitive world,

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:57.400
 not just the US, like the whole world, right?

00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:01.040
 We're competing as a country with all these other countries.

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:02.400
 A lot of them are catching up to us

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:03.560
 in a bunch of different ways.

00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:05.240
 We're always looking for ways to stay ahead

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:11.480
 to like, you know, try to create the world that we want.

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:14.400
 And certain countries have certain advantages.

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.440
 And other countries just don't have certain advantages.

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:19.280
 We have one of the most amazing advantages

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:20.960
 that no other country has,

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:22.840
 and we refuse to take advantage of it.

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:26.280
 America exports like a shit ton of culture, right?

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:29.600
 People know our movies, people know our music,

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:33.160
 people know our lifestyles, people know like

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:35.400
 all over the world, people know it.

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:37.600
 And it maybe doesn't click for everyone,

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:40.280
 but there are a large number of people that see that.

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:42.440
 And they're like, I would love to have that.

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:45.080
 I'd love to be in the country where all this culture

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:48.080
 that I see, you know, that I'm into.

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:49.520
 I want to be there.

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:51.800
 There's so many people from all over the world

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:54.840
 that would just love for a chance to come here.

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:59.720
 And for some reason, we don't have a policy of being like,

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:02.800
 yeah, the best people from every country get to come here.

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:04.760
 Like if you can, and I pay,

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:06.800
 like we make immigration so complicated and hard.

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:11.960
 I know so many people that are like offered amazing jobs here

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:13.960
 where if they came here and they got that job,

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:15.160
 they would be making a lot of money,

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:16.880
 they'd be paying a lot of taxes.

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:19.960
 I just a very talented person that someone in America

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:21.200
 is like, we need this person here

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.160
 to make our company more productive.

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:25.000
 And we make it so, so difficult.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.440
 Like it's such a complex process.

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:30.800
 It ends up being sheer chance of like a lottery involved in it.

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:33.000
 And this is like our craziest advantage

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.040
 that all are like, quote unquote, like,

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.320
 like our front of me countries or like our enemy countries

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:39.720
 that we're trying to compete with.

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:41.880
 Their citizens would just rather live here.

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:44.120
 They would just rather come here and do the work

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:45.520
 that they're doing making their country.

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:46.960
 They could just do it for us.

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.000
 - Yeah.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.720
 - And historically we've just had,

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:51.480
 and if you look at like some of the greatest things

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:52.320
 that America has done,

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:55.240
 it's been through people that have come over in this way, right?

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:57.840
 And that's like an unstoppable advantage.

00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:02.320
 And I'm like, why do we continue to like squander it?

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:03.800
 Like we overcomplicate it.

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:07.760
 We're like, well, that job that this foreign person

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:09.680
 would take, like that could have gone to an American person.

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:11.280
 But if you really look at the number of open roles

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:12.320
 that every company,

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:13.920
 they just have a shit ton of open roles

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:16.280
 that are never going to fill because it's not like

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:18.720
 they would have filled it with an American citizen.

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:20.720
 They just aren't going to fill at all.

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:21.880
 And that's like a limiter on,

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.040
 it's a limiter of so many things.

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:24.840
 Like the company presumably puts that job out

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:27.640
 because if someone fills that

00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:30.480
 and they pay $200,000 to that person,

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:33.320
 they might make a million dollars off of that person being there.

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:36.560
 So it's all this like untapped wealth and opportunity

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:39.680
 that these companies aren't able to take advantage of.

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:40.920
 So the whole immigration thing, I'm like,

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:44.480
 this is like the answer to so many of our problems.

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:46.840
 But we like just really, really, really overcomplicate.

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:48.640
 And we do this other really stupid thing

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:52.760
 where we let people come here on a student visa.

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:56.080
 We're like, okay, you can come study at our universities.

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:59.360
 And then we make it really hard for them to then turn that

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:02.800
 into like a job that way they can stay here.

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:05.480
 But people literally come here and get educated,

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:07.840
 then leave and go back to their country

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.680
 and we just don't get the ROI.

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:12.000
 It's just like, it's so stupid

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.040
 and it seems this is an obvious one.

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:14.920
 And I don't think this is unpopular.

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:16.880
 I don't think this is a thing that like,

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:19.160
 I think a lot of people are like, yeah, that's fine.

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.480
 Like I think there maybe are a select group

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:22.560
 to people that don't like it.

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:24.160
 But I think, I wouldn't be surprised

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:25.680
 that this was like in the majority of things

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:26.800
 that people were down for.

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:28.480
 - Could you state the solution?

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:29.320
 You might have already said it,

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:30.920
 but is the idea just like,

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:33.720
 you like let people in based on merit,

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:36.600
 basically like if they're good at stuff,

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:38.720
 they get in first, is that the idea?

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:40.080
 - I don't know what the exact roles will be

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:42.040
 'cause it probably is a little bit complicated,

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:44.120
 but from a first principle point of view,

00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:46.680
 if someone can, if there's a company here

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:49.920
 that is like, I'm willing to pay this person X amount of money

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:52.320
 and it's like over a certain threshold,

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:53.680
 that's just a net benefit for everyone.

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:56.200
 We're gonna get tax revenue from that as a government,

00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:57.040
 the company's gonna make money.

00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:00.080
 So I feel like if you can secure a job here,

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:02.280
 it should be a pretty smooth process.

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:03.760
 And of course, like we need to have processes

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:04.600
 for things outside of that,

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:05.440
 like we currently have,

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:09.840
 but just that specific situation we should allow for

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:11.600
 'cause there are, and of course,

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:13.680
 people are tired of saying, well, not everyone wants to go.

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:14.920
 Of course, not everyone wants to come here,

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:18.080
 but there are, compared to every country in the world,

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:20.400
 we do have that advantage still.

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.360
 We're losing it a little bit

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:23.720
 'cause we're not taking advantage of it,

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:28.080
 but it's still gonna continue to be a force that exists

00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:29.840
 and we should maximize it while we can.

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:31.280
 - That all makes sense to me.

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:34.680
 I've never, I've never not put a thought to immigration.

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:35.840
 I don't know if it's 'cause I live

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:38.760
 in the geographic center of the continent

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:41.360
 and we don't get a lot of immigration around here.

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:43.040
 I just literally have no thoughts.

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:44.560
 So I'm sorry, I can't be more of a sandy board.

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:45.920
 You were such a good sandy board

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.160
 when I was ranting about guns.

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:49.280
 And now I'm just like, cool, it sounds great.

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:50.680
 I'm on board.

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:51.680
 Let's bring in the best people.

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:54.080
 - No, this is just my little, see, that's my point.

00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:55.840
 It's like, it's so simple.

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:57.240
 And it's like, I think most people would be like,

00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:58.080
 yeah, that makes sense.

00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:00.120
 Like there's not much to talk about.

00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:01.480
 But yeah, I think we all know,

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:02.320
 like I know people that,

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:05.000
 I know this guy that, I mean, I didn't go to college

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.560
 and I don't put a lot of weight in degrees,

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:09.320
 but he technically had probably equivalent

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:11.560
 of like a PhD plus a master's in America

00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:12.560
 and he was from France.

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:13.400
 - Yeah.

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:14.240
 - Like infinite job offers.

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:16.480
 Like every company wanted to hire him.

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:18.080
 Every company wanted to hire him.

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:20.360
 He actually came here illegally in a way,

00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:22.600
 or he overstayed his visa technically.

00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:23.440
 And the company was working,

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:25.040
 I was like paying him out of the table.

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:27.160
 Like everyone would have hired him.

00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:30.280
 Like just really smart dude, really, really capable.

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:32.600
 He ended up marrying his roommates.

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:34.560
 His roommate did him a favor and she married him.

00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:37.920
 They both had like the real partners

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:40.400
 and they did a fake marriage.

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:42.000
 And then after two years, they got divorced.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.520
 - But he had to do all these stupid work rounds.

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:44.640
 - Yeah, these stupid things.

00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:46.120
 And he hustled and figured it out, which is all,

00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:47.080
 but again, which is a point.

00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:50.000
 Like he's willing to do all this really crazy shit

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.600
 just to bring his talents here, right?

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:53.440
 - Yeah.

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:56.040
 - And I was like, it's so dumb that that was his process.

00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:57.560
 And I know a lot of people, to be honest,

00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:01.200
 would have been through this in my process and it's just bizarre.

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:02.480
 - It is bizarre.

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:05.760
 Yeah, I don't have a thoughts on immigration so much,

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:07.600
 but it just sounds like one of those things

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:08.440
 that we would be bad at.

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:12.640
 Just like, I don't know, a lot of the decisions we make,

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:15.800
 not that I think it's corruption is just like incompetence.

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:18.560
 Like a lot of elderly people running the government,

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:21.600
 just like things that seem like common sense to me,

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:24.080
 just don't seem to be like common sense, I don't know.

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:26.200
 - I mean, if you look at every big company that was founded,

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:28.920
 a really great American company, like a large percentage

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:31.960
 of them was from these people that managed to get in.

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:33.880
 Someone's asking why can they do H1B?

00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:38.120
 The problem with the H1B is that the last step is random.

00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:39.960
 Their company can sponsor you, do everything,

00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:41.480
 but it's a fixed number.

00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:44.000
 And it's a lottery once you get past the initial filters.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.280
 So it's like 1/3 of people every year, make it through.

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:50.600
 - Oh, you know what country is not like this?

00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:51.680
 Canada.

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:54.800
 So Canada literally is doing almost everything what I say.

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:57.120
 They let any competent person in it, they just let them in.

00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:59.040
 It's like super easy to immigrate to Canada.

00:44:59.040 --> 00:44:59.880
 - Yeah.

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:01.160
 - That's why you look at Canadian cities,

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:02.400
 they're like really diverse.

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:04.560
 A lot of them eventually end up coming in to America

00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:07.440
 through Canada, it's like a two-step process.

00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:10.040
 But yeah, Canada, I mean like Toronto's like tech scene

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:11.320
 is like growing like crazy.

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:13.000
 Like there's just a lot of cool stuff happening

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:13.840
 because of this.

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:16.600
 - And they've got the culture, I mean, maple syrup,

00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:19.560
 Mounties, what do they call it?

00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:21.720
 The people with the hats that ride the horses,

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:24.760
 like policemen, they got all kinds of culture in Canada.

00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:25.960
 So we better watch out,

00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:27.640
 or people are going to be flooding into Canada.

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:29.200
 People could come to America.

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:31.840
 - Yeah, well they still need our military, but you know.

00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:33.160
 - Do we want to talk about the military?

00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:34.000
 Okay, sorry.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:34.840
 I just--

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:35.840
 (laughing)

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:38.640
 - I mean, if you can, if you want to talk about it.

00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:41.400
 - Do you feel like we do way too much in the world?

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:45.040
 - Yeah, like with everything I land somewhere coming in--

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:45.880
 - It's complex.

00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:47.040
 - It's complex, yeah, it's kind of--

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:50.480
 - Yeah, like I like really buy into this theory

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:54.520
 of the value or dollar directly tied to our military.

00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:55.360
 - So--

00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:56.360
 - Wait, what, what's that theory?

00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:57.240
 I don't know that theory.

00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:58.360
 - I'm not going to be like explain this

00:45:58.360 --> 00:45:59.200
 because I don't understand it.

00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:02.240
 Won't have to explain it well, but I'll try.

00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:04.560
 We effectively like secure all the trade routes

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:05.640
 in the world, right?

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:08.360
 All global trade, like Western global trade,

00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:10.400
 like we, like our military secures it.

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:11.760
 That's why we're literally everywhere.

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:12.680
 - Oh, interesting.

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:14.320
 - Yeah, I didn't know that.

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:16.480
 - Yeah, and there's a reason that we're everywhere.

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:19.400
 - It's not just in exchange for this,

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.920
 the world operates on dollars.

00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:22.920
 So the creates a base level demand for dollar.

00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:26.640
 Again, that's another crazy, crazy advantage we have, right?

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:30.600
 All like energy trade, all oil trade is done with dollars.

00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:33.040
 It creates this like global base level demand for it,

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:37.280
 which lets us do crazy things like print money and invest it

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:39.880
 'cause there's like enough demand to support that.

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:42.520
 So yes, we spend a lot in the military,

00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:43.360
 probably too much.

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:44.440
 I imagine it is too much

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:46.920
 'cause it is a government and the government is not efficient.

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:48.280
 I'm sure we're spending too much,

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:51.040
 but I'm multiple for the results we're getting.

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:54.160
 But I do think people simplify it in that like,

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:56.520
 oh, we're not getting anything for it, but.

00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:57.360
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:58.200
 And I don't believe that.

00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:01.200
 - There is like an ROI loop that's coming back

00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:02.840
 just from us controlling it really.

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:04.640
 - When you say securing the trade route,

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:07.560
 is that like from pirates or from like other nations?

00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:08.640
 Like what?

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:12.640
 - No, it's more like, there is like a clear history of this

00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:14.800
 and I don't, I need to read up on it

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:16.080
 so I can like articulate this better.

00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:17.720
 I read it once and it made a lot of sense

00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:20.960
 and I forgot, but this was like after World War II,

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:23.320
 like all like the things that happened

00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:27.160
 where like all the other countries

00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:28.760
 were pretty much their economies were broken.

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:30.160
 So they always pegged the US dollar

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:31.720
 and then the US dollar was supposed to be pegged to gold.

00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:33.960
 And then a bunch of stuff happened with that.

00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:35.040
 Again, I don't remember.

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:36.720
 So I'm just gonna sound like an idiot trying to explain it,

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:41.720
 but effectively like when like the West came into being,

00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:44.440
 which is like just our allies

00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:46.920
 and like entirely what we think of as the West,

00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:50.920
 it's also cured by the US military primarily.

00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:52.800
 - Okay.

00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:54.840
 - When I say literally, when I say securing trade routes,

00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:57.000
 I don't mean like from pirates,

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.800
 I just mean in general, like we're all allied

00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:03.960
 under this like military agreements effectively.

00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:04.800
 - Okay.

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:06.320
 - And that's what enables us to trade with each other

00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:09.160
 and work with each other and we're all, we're all better.

00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:10.520
 - I can't believe I've never heard any of this.

00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:12.040
 This seems like important information.

00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:13.560
 - Yeah, I wish I knew it better.

00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:14.760
 I wish I knew it better.

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:16.120
 - At least you knew something.

00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:18.520
 Okay, I kind of want to talk about pirates,

00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:19.880
 but I feel like we should end the episode.

00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:21.200
 - How about pirates?

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:22.480
 - Like pirates are real, right?

00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:24.640
 Like they're real thing that like,

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:27.640
 are those people that, do they like live amongst us?

00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:29.800
 Do they come into society or do they just live on the boats?

00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:31.800
 - They live amongst us, what the?

00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:33.080
 - It's not me because I'm inland,

00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:34.880
 but like our pirates, normal people,

00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:36.640
 do they speak languages, we speak?

00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:39.960
 Or are they like born on the ship and they're raised pirate

00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:41.800
 and they're totally different from us?

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:42.640
 - No.

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:46.120
 - Well, I said there aren't pirates

00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:48.160
 of the Caribbean pirates out there.

00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:50.160
 - No. - Yeah, I knew they didn't wear the whole costume

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.000
 with the parrot and the whole thing.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.120
 I knew that, but like, how different are they from us?

00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:57.560
 Are they like the people who live in Antarctica?

00:48:57.560 --> 00:48:59.720
 No, in the cold places.

00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:01.800
 You're not supposed to call Mexico, so what are they called?

00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:03.120
 - Inuits?

00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:04.240
 - Inuits, thank you.

00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:05.240
 - Hang on, hang on, hang on.

00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:06.320
 Why am I such an event of it?

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:07.160
 Okay, go ahead.

00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:08.280
 - Piracy is just an act of desperation.

00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:10.080
 There's some people that are desperate enough

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:12.760
 to risk their lives to go out on a little boat

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:14.120
 to attack a big boat.

00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:18.920
 So they're just people in places that are like, you know,

00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:21.840
 that are poorer or like, you know, have more desperation.

00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:24.240
 So my only, I don't know anything about this,

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:27.200
 but I only know about the Captain Phillips stuff

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:29.960
 and the stuff that happens off of the coast of Africa,

00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:31.680
 like in Somalia and stuff, so.

00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:34.160
 - Okay, so they are just people who like,

00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:36.640
 they live in the cities and then they get on a boat

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:38.400
 and they go out and steal stuff at other boats.

00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:43.040
 - Yeah, okay, it's crazy to me that they do that, but.

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:43.880
 - No, no, it's crazy.

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:46.360
 Yeah, I just didn't know if it was like a whole population

00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:49.480
 of people that had very different, like, I don't know.

00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:51.200
 - Well, what is crazy is historically

00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:52.600
 where you're describing was a thing, right?

00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:55.360
 Like, like Tortuga was like a real place.

00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:56.640
 I don't know where it is, but like,

00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:59.520
 there were like pirate cities where like,

00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:01.240
 I gotta read more into this 'cause.

00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:02.240
 - A pirate city.

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:05.040
 - Because back when piracy was like a bigger thing,

00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:07.040
 like the images of it we have of it.

00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:09.200
 - Some would say it's still a pretty bad problem, Dax.

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:11.520
 Especially when you talk about pirates in like movies

00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:14.360
 and TV shows and stuff where it's a navel, it's a problem.

00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:17.800
 - Navel, navel piracy, navel piracy.

00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:21.200
 Ocean-based piracy.

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:22.920
 But there was enough of a thing where they were like,

00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:25.360
 pirate cities where like, that's where the pirates

00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:27.040
 would dock and hang out.

00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:28.000
 That's really crazy.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:28.840
 - I gotta read about this.

00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:30.160
 That sounds very fascinating.

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:31.460
 Tortuga, you said?

00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:32.320
 - I don't know, that sounds good.

00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:33.160
 That sounds right.

00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:34.000
 - Hold that off the dome.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.440
 You've read 10 books in your life

00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:36.880
 and you know these kind of words.

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:38.880
 Like, where are you getting this information?

00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:40.160
 - Tortuga, that sounds familiar, right?

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:41.560
 - Tortuga, no, it doesn't at all.

00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:43.320
 That's why when you said it, my face went--

00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:44.480
 - Tortuga.

00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:45.320
 - Tortuga.

00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:47.600
 - Tortuga, pirate city.

00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:48.440
 (laughs)

00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:49.280
 - Oh my God.

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:50.120
 - It's a Pokemon.

00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:51.460
 - Okay, it's in Haiti.

00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:52.800
 Okay.

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:54.240
 - Oh, it's actually a thing, okay.

00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:55.960
 - Yeah, it's in Haiti.

00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:59.440
 Major center and haven of Caribbean piracy.

00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:01.060
 Look at that, I didn't make it up.

00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:02.920
 - You didn't make it up, Tortuga.

00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:06.200
 I'm just so curious when that word graced Dax's ears.

00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:07.040
 And he retained it.

00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:09.680
 - Yeah, I mean, I think it's a nice name.

00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:11.480
 Does it mean turtle or tortoise?

00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:13.400
 - Oh, you could name your kid Tortuga.

00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:15.640
 (laughs)

00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:17.080
 Throwin' that out there.

00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:18.160
 All right, I really have to pee.

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:20.000
 So we do have to get off here.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.600
 I don't like that to be our sign off

00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:22.920
 that I always had to pee at the end.

00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:23.840
 I don't like it.

00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:24.680
 - I like it.

00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:25.520
 I think it's funny.

00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:26.340
 - But it's us.

00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:27.800
 I mean, it's just the reality that I drink a lot

00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:28.640
 and I have to pee.

00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:30.040
 - You drink a lot.

00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:31.720
 And that's the source of all your problems.

00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:33.040
 You drink a lot.

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:33.880
 - I don't drink a lot.

00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:35.040
 I don't drink alcohol.

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:36.360
 I just do weed, man.

00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:37.320
 - Okay. - Just cool.

00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:38.400
 - So we're gonna add this podcast.

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:41.200
 I have no idea what the hell this is gonna turn into.

00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:42.040
 - I don't either.

00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:42.960
 Chris, it's up to you.

00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:45.000
 If this is one episode, if it's two, three,

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.400
 whatever you think, if it's none,

00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:47.840
 if we just need to throw this one in the trash,

00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:48.680
 it was a good time.

00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:50.320
 We all got to feel a little better at the end.

00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:51.240
 We feel better, right?

00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:52.800
 Should I become some villain

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:54.600
 and you can be the person everyone identifies with

00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:55.920
 and I'm like this jerk.

00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:56.760
 I'll do it.

00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:57.600
 I don't care.

00:51:57.600 --> 00:51:59.880
 I have nothing else really going for me on the internet.

00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:02.120
 I'll just become some figure that people hate

00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:03.680
 and they're like that, Adam.

00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:05.920
 Oh my God, I just wanna punch him in the face.

00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:07.080
 I could be that guy.

00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:08.280
 - 'Cause you don't care.

00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:09.520
 - I really don't care.

00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:11.560
 At this point, I'm considering just going off the internet.

00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:13.480
 You've seen my farewell to the internet video.

00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:15.040
 I'm considering it.

00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:16.760
 I'm considering literally just disappearing.

00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:18.760
 - That's all the drugs talking.

00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:20.000
 - It's not the drugs.

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:20.840
 - How do we know?

00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:21.680
 - I don't do drugs.

00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:25.640
 That sounds so like, okay, well, I mean like,

00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:26.760
 what kind of drugs?

00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:28.800
 Pharmaceutical drugs, lots of people do those.

00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:29.640
 We don't talk about that.

00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:30.480
 - Oh, wow.

00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:31.320
 - We can get into that stuff.

00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:32.240
 Big pharma.

00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:35.480
 I should, okay, listen, I should just become a villain.

00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:37.800
 I should become this person people hate.

00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:39.520
 You'll get so much from it,

00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:42.280
 I can at least have a purpose on the internet.

00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:44.120
 I think we got something here.

00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:46.000
 I'll just, I'll go against everything,

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.520
 not like consistently, not like some groups gonna hate me.

00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:49.360
 They'll all hate me,

00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:52.080
 because I'll say something they all hate.

00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:52.920
 How about that?

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:53.880
 I feel like you're not taking me seriously.

00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:55.120
 I'm not joking right now.

00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:57.560
 - I don't, okay, this may be offensive,

00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:00.480
 but I don't think you have it.

00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:02.400
 I don't think you have what it takes to do that.

00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:04.760
 (laughs)

00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:06.080
 - What do you mean?

00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:07.200
 - It's not a mean thing.

00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:10.560
 It's like, I just don't see you as the villain character.

00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:11.400
 - Really?

00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:12.720
 - That'll make it so much more interesting.

00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:14.400
 That I don't seem like I should be a villain,

00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:16.280
 but you just hate me.

00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:18.440
 Not a villain, but just like a guy who says things

00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:20.840
 in Flammatory and everybody's like in a ruckus.

00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:23.160
 And ruckus, is that a word?

00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:24.320
 In a ruckus?

00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:26.880
 In a, like everybody's in a tizzy?

00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:27.880
 - In a tizzy word?

00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:31.080
 - In a tizzy, oh my god, what race are you again?

00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:31.920
 - I forgot.

00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:33.080
 - What do you, I'm white.

00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:33.920
 I don't know.

00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:34.760
 (laughs)

00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:35.600
 - I'm just in a tizzy.

00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:36.440
 - Is that a race?

00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:37.280
 - Is that a race?

00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:39.200
 - That's a very white shit, yeah.

00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:41.600
 - Oh, how could I say something really offensive here?

00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:42.760
 - Nah, I can't think of anything.

00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:43.760
 I gotta do this though.

00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:45.520
 I feel like some people got angry after this episode

00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:47.880
 if they hear it, if it ever makes a lie today.

00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:49.040
 I gotta lean into it.

00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:52.160
 'Cause I really need some kind of purpose on the internet.

00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:54.120
 I have lots of purposes in actual life,

00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:56.840
 but like on the internet, I don't know.

00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:59.480
 I hate when you do that, Dax, why do you do that?

00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:00.840
 Why do you just sit there and stare at me?

00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:02.240
 I hate it so much.

00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:04.200
 Okay, goodbye, I gotta pee.

00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:05.280
 I'm floating, bye.

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:06.120
 - Bye.

00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:09.860
 (upbeat music)
