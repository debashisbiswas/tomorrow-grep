WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960
 - Do you want to do a thousand episodes?

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:02.960
 Are you good with that?

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:03.800
 (laughing)

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.160
 - We'll see, we'll get to 100 first.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.160
 - Okay, yeah, good.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.000
 - If I saw like you by then.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.800
 - Baby steps, if you still like me.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.640
 (laughing)

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.480
 - It's a change.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.320
 - We might lose our audience right here.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.160
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.000
 - It was a good run.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.700
 (upbeat music)

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.840
 - Yeah, it only was FM.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.720
 I feel like you just ended up talking to everyone,

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.600
 but you were done.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.000
 - Yeah, I mean, well, I actually like,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.160
 it was the opposite for me.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.560
 I had so many people I wanted to talk to.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.320
 It got overwhelming, like just trying to like,

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.120
 it's like who do you pick and who can come on win?

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.600
 And I don't know, I probably had like 100 more people

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.920
 I would have interviewed or talked with.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.080
 I did talk with a lot of people I wanted to talk with.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.080
 I mean, I was just trying to like, get it all in.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.960
 I was doing like three a week, like, I was doing games.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:05.960
 It was just a lot of work.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.440
 I'm looking back on it now,

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.880
 thinking about how easy this podcast is

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.360
 and how difficult that was.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.520
 - Well, people really liked it.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.560
 - Well, people like this.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.920
 This is, I think we've almost got as many downloads

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.760
 as I got it on that one.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.600
 - Oh, okay.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.460
 Well, yeah, I guess we hit the same milestone

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.160
 with like 10 times this effort.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.960
 That's like, that's a little less than in content

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:24.800
 a lot of times.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.400
 - It really is.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.560
 Just care less, do less.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.200
 Be yourself, but don't be to yourself

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.760
 'cause that can get you in trouble too.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.760
 - Like when you took off your shirt

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.480
 and took a picture and posted it on Twitter.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.040
 - Okay, yeah, that's not what I was talking about.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.600
 Listen, I get in shape really easy.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.440
 It's a gift.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.600
 It's like my body, I've not done enough work

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.760
 to be in the shape that I'm in.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.840
 It just happens really fast.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.680
 I've always been that way.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.800
 Like in school, like I had to play sports

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.080
 because I was just tall.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.640
 I was like twice as tall as anybody,

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.640
 especially in middle school, I shot up immediately.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.920
 I've been this height since I was like 12.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.520
 I was taller than like my third grade teacher

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.040
 and I've been this height ever since.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.400
 But like, I was a big kid.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.440
 It was a big kid.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.280
 I was already tall.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.160
 And I was just like, I looked like a college athlete.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.880
 I just had like a body I didn't deserve.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.960
 So I had to play sports and I never really was that into it.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.680
 Like I didn't really wanna,

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.080
 I probably wouldn't have played sports

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.640
 if I weren't just like, - Really?

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.280
 People made me because I was tall.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.520
 It was peer pressure.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.720
 But it's great in adulthood.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.800
 Like I don't have to do that much.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.920
 And I feel like, wow, I'm getting fit.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.200
 - My body is similar in that I have to work out to gain weight.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.880
 Like if I stop paying attention,

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.600
 like I don't like get fat, I get skinnier

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.120
 'cause my body naturally wants to be

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.400
 at like a pretty skinny zone.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.960
 And people hate that.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.800
 - I was gonna say, people are gonna hate this episode.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.720
 We're like, I don't do anything.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.560
 I get fit.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.400
 I lose weight.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.240
 I don't know what to do.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.480
 I'm gonna work out so I don't get too small.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.320
 - Yeah.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.160
 (laughs)

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.000
 - Wow.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.640
 - Yeah.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.080
 - We might lose our whole audience right here.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.920
 That was good one.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:00.760
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.600
 It was a good run.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.720
 Maybe we'll pick up like a fitness audience.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.720
 Maybe a bunch of people who like aspire to be into fitness.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.560
 - Nah, yeah.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.320
 I mean, I don't know if we're there yet,

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.040
 but there's some people at my gym then just unreal.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.120
 Some unreal, like beasts.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.960
 - Oh yeah.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.760
 - That's why I don't go to gyms.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.160
 I go to gym, like if I go to gym one time,

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.960
 I'm just demotivated and I never wanna go back.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.320
 'Cause you just, you gotta start somewhere

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.400
 and that's the hard part about going to a gym.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.560
 If you're going for the first time,

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.520
 you're probably not that fit.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.000
 So you're gonna look like an idiot

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.320
 trying to lift anything in these people in there,

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.280
 like bouncing off the walls and throwing weight

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.120
 through the air.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.560
 Like, I'm just not gonna do it.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.080
 I've always had something in my home

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.640
 where I can work out at home,

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.280
 which I guess is privilege, but.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.800
 - It's a big hurdle.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.000
 I used to, like, would stop me from going to the gym a lot.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.160
 And I think I even, like, worked out on my own

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.920
 to, like, work up into the gym.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.400
 But you just get past the point

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.000
 where, like, you're pretty comfortable in there

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.840
 and it doesn't really matter.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.200
 You're mostly just impressed by some of those people

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.720
 and it's like they're looking at you

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.680
 and judging you for being weak.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.840
 But yeah, there's some people,

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.960
 'cause I, 'cause I, so I technically go to a crossfit gym.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.360
 I mostly do solo stuff here.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.200
 - I was gonna ask.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.480
 I wanted to bring it up.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.320
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.480
 (laughing)

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.400
 So there's some people there that compete

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.300
 in the crossfit games.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.200
 And yes, everyone does across at me.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.560
 Everyone finds crossfit people, annoying, blah, blah.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.840
 But just straight up, like, the people that compete

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.400
 in those games are, like, some of the fittest people

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.240
 on the planet.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.640
 Like, it just tests so many different aspects of fitness.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.240
 So if you're at that level, you're incredible.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.840
 And there's one guy there that I think,

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.160
 I don't think it's at the highest levels,

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.960
 but he's, like, pretty close.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.800
 And I just cannot believe, like, the level endurance he has.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.120
 Like, like, I don't go to the classes there often.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.640
 I just do my own thing.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.240
 But I was in a class one time with him.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.680
 And we had a workout that would take me, like, 40 to 50 minutes.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.160
 And I wouldn't even really finish it.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.840
 I would, like, kind of, like, taper off towards the end

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.200
 and, like, cut what I was doing a little bit.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.120
 He literally finished the whole thing in 20 minutes

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.280
 and then went back to his own thing.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.280
 (laughing)

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.960
 And I just could not believe how fast he was going

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:07.800
 through this stuff.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.520
 And I was like, man, people get, like, the peak

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.160
 of what you can do is so insane.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.520
 - Yeah, I guess if I lived in Miami

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.400
 and I got to watch, like, elite crossfitters,

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.480
 I might be into it.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.440
 But, I don't know, the Ozarks, maybe less of that.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.600
 Oh, there's probably some people.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.440
 I'm not giving them credit.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.080
 There's a lot of, like, just corn fed strength

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.920
 here in the US.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.520
 It's like, they come from the fields

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.800
 and they're already huge and ripped.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.280
 And, yeah.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.240
 - My previous gym in New York,

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.920
 it's got, other than a neighborhood that was,

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.720
 I don't have kids, but other than a neighborhood

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.200
 that was, like, everyone had, like, a two or three-year-old,

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.440
 like, kind of, like, first child, like, new parents.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.920
 Yeah, the gym I would go to there.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.400
 It was, like, it was a completely different vibe.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.000
 It was, everyone there was clearly

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.600
 to try to squeeze in, like, 20 minutes of something

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.920
 just so, like, not completely fall apart.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.320
 And, when I was there, I felt like one of the more fit people.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.840
 So, that was motivating in a different way, I think.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.040
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.240
 You gotta be kind of, like, in the middle.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.360
 If you're on the extremes, there's probably less.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.920
 Like, if you're super fit and you go into the gym,

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.560
 what motivates you, I guess?

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.960
 Like, how do you not just feel like--

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:10.800
 - Do you feel like--

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:11.640
 - I'm good.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:12.480
 - Yeah, right.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.920
 Just look in the mirror.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.800
 (groans)

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.800
 It's like when you're doing a lot of streaming on Twitch.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.960
 I know you're doing that partner grind.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.440
 I know, like, once I got partner,

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.680
 I didn't care to stream anymore.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.440
 It's amazing, the effect.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.680
 It's like, once you've made it,

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.520
 it just kind of, I don't know, what am I doing now?

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.640
 I got other stuff to do.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.160
 - I just wanna do weirder things.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.320
 I feel trapped right now.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.760
 I feel like there's a certain time of day.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.040
 I can only stream, and if I stream in off hours,

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.640
 and it hurts my progress, and--

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.160
 - Yep. - Yeah, so, I wanna get past it,

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.240
 'cause I have a bunch of weirder things I wanna do

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.680
 that might not land at all, so.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.480
 - Maybe that's the key, though.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.360
 Maybe that's what would just unlock crazy growth

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.840
 and people would be showing up from all over it.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.000
 But I know exactly what you're talking about.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.640
 I never wanted to do anything off the normal schedule.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.040
 I just wanted to keep the pattern.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.360
 And it was nice, as soon as I got partner,

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.040
 I remember doing an afternoon stream,

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.440
 and it's just like, who cares?

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.520
 Kind of if you want, I don't care.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.360
 - Yeah.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.200
 - But then for what?

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.360
 It's so funny, like, Twitch is in the news,

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.880
 where there's like, all this stuff through.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.360
 Yeah, I mean, do you understand?

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.600
 I didn't do it all.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.000
 There was like a big, ah, they said bad things.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.200
 They're hostile to the community,

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.240
 and then they were like, nevermind, sorry.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.160
 I've never seen such a quick reversal.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.040
 - Yeah, I am so confused by it.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.800
 So just to summarize, they basically put out a policy

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.720
 that very clearly made it seem like they were attacking

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.160
 people for getting their own sponsors,

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.280
 so people that have their own things they promote,

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.240
 their own ads they put up on an overlay,

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.320
 which is pretty critical 'cause Twitch doesn't pay that much,

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.240
 so finding your own sponsors a deal is for your niche,

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.120
 like, makes a lot of sense, and obviously everyone does that.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.480
 So it felt, it's like, what the hell?

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.560
 Like, why are they going after that?

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.160
 That seems like really insane.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.160
 Obviously this is a bad idea.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.800
 But everything was phrased to make it sound

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.920
 that's exactly like what they were doing.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.440
 But then they later clarified saying, oh, sorry,

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.520
 that's like not what we meant.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.840
 Like, we were going after these weird third-party ad networks

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.320
 that try to operate inside Twitch,

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.680
 which I get, like, I get why they don't want to have that.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:09.520
 - Oh.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.280
 - Like, is this like the worst unforced error of all time?

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.120
 Like, if that's, they were going for something so specific,

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.920
 if that is true, and they accidentally did, like,

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:19.920
 the worst thing ever.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.200
 Like, I don't even know how that happens,

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.280
 and they reversed it, and there was a community,

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.040
 you see on Twitter, they're, so they posted on Twitter,

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.120
 like, we're sorry about this,

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.480
 we've removed this from our terms of service, whatever.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.320
 - Yeah.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.680
 - Then Twitter slapped the community, you know, on it,

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.640
 being like, they haven't actually done this.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:37.960
 (laughing)

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.400
 - Oh, you see, wow.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.280
 So they're just trying to, like, say that they walked it back,

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.720
 but they're potentially still hedging their bet,

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.560
 they don't know what they're going to do.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.520
 - Maybe they didn't, actually, I have no idea what's going on.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:50.280
 It just seems like the dumbest unforced thing ever.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.120
 I don't know.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:51.960
 - So much outrage, right?

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.960
 Like, people, I really respect that are not, like,

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.040
 just reacting to everything they hear,

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.040
 seem like they are pretty out on Twitch.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.400
 I mean, I've seen people discussing,

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.000
 like, what are the alternatives, all that stuff.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.960
 Do you think that that actually happens?

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.400
 Is it just not a good business?

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.760
 - It's a terrible business.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:08.880
 It's such a bad business.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:13.320
 - Is it just that, like, streaming to the masses,

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.960
 being able to, anybody, just being able to sign up

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.280
 and start streaming, is just never going to be a thing.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.360
 Like, eventually that'll go away,

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.600
 and it'll just be, like, big time personalities will stream,

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.080
 'cause that's the only way to make money.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.920
 - I have no idea how this all shakes out,

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.640
 'cause it means, like, streaming video.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.840
 I can't even understand how Twitch exists.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.720
 Like, you just let me go and do this,

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.960
 and make, basically, no money off of me.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:34.800
 Maybe someone, okay.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.880
 Maybe they're making, like, basically nothing now.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.720
 Maybe they're covering whatever costs that I'm causing them.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.560
 - Yeah.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.400
 - Yeah, these live videos are so expensive,

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.200
 and just to have, like, thousands of people streaming,

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.000
 potentially tens of thousands of people streaming.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.760
 It's just, like, really cool concept.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:50.600
 I love it.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.440
 I love Twitch.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.920
 Like, I love the whole, like--

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:53.760
 - I do too, yeah.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.480
 - That would exist, but it clearly has to be, like,

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.920
 a lost leader for something else.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.880
 Like, I'm glad that Amazon owns Twitch,

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:03.280
 because the whole thing with video streaming is,

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.800
 everyone's like, let's build a competitor to Twitch,

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.440
 but that means using some other video hosting infrastructure.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.960
 And those are all so expensive,

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.160
 'cause this whole thing is so expensive.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.400
 It's not really reliable.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.880
 I think I did some quick math thing for Prime

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:19.120
 for two hours streaming will cost them 240 bucks,

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.080
 which maybe you could still come out ahead on that.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.960
 And you probably would, but it's expensive.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.520
 So the only way to build a business that does this

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.680
 is to, like, go lower on down the stack

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.800
 and, like, own your hardware,

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.200
 and, like, put stuff in data centers.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.640
 I'm like, do you really want to do all that work

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.760
 just so you can end up, like, Twitch,

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.200
 like, struggling to make any amount of money?

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.320
 It's just not a fun business.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.920
 - Yeah, it just occurred to me that, like, I don't know,

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:46.400
 but why is it so expensive to stream video?

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.560
 I was thinking of, like, TV, it's been around forever.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:51.520
 Well, how did they figure it out?

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.160
 I guess physical infrastructure is, like,

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.080
 piping cables to everybody's houses.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:55.920
 - Well, that's what I mean.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.320
 You have to go lower down the stack.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.160
 - I'll explain.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.000
 I didn't get that.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:10:59.840
 I didn't understand.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.360
 - The fastest way, 'cause at this point,

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.360
 I don't want to start any business

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.480
 where I have to, like, chip servers,

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.160
 'cause that's just a not-fun business.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.400
 So I use-- - Oh, wow, yeah.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.240
 - Oh, wow, yeah.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.640
 - So I use, like, middlemen, like, AWS

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.240
 or a Cloudflare or whatever.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.080
 - Uh-huh.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.960
 - But if you try to use them for live video,

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.600
 it's, like, really expensive and not really viable for--

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.440
 - Yeah.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.560
 - Like, only for, like, smaller things.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.920
 It's maybe viable.

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:24.120
 So then you go back to the days of having to, like,

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.840
 you know, like, manage your own servers,

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:26.920
 and, like, manage your data centers,

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.400
 and, like, write, like, low-level code

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.840
 that does all this stuff, so--

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.640
 - So the cable company, you're saying, like,

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.920
 the cable company is just, like,

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:38.400
 they got their own physical infrastructure.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.960
 That's being as low to the stack as you can be.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.720
 - Yeah, and I think Twitch also has, like,

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.600
 their own physical infrastructure,

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.780
 now they're owned by AWS, so there's, like,

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:47.760
 you know, AWS has the lowest cost of any company

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.360
 on the planet for infrastructure, so--

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.600
 - I guess that's probably the only reason Twitch is viable.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.640
 Still, they're still alive, is that AWS can,

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.320
 with their scale, they can actually--

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.160
 - Yeah.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.360
 And I don't even know how much they've moved onto AWS's stuff,

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.680
 but, yeah, like, long-term, it's, like,

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.440
 those are gonna be the lowest cost of anyone on the planet.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:06.280
 - Yeah.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.600
 - I don't know.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.680
 So, yeah, it's just a terrible business,

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.720
 but also, it's just, like, there's that side of it,

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:16.800
 but also, it's so clearly, like, it feels like a company,

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.040
 just from seeing the people that have worked there

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.760
 that have talked about it, it's, like,

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:23.480
 they're so clearly in that stage where they're, like, done.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.200
 They're, like, not really gonna do anything great again.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.360
 It's, like, everyone at the company is, like,

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:30.800
 hmm, just, like, a post doing anything good company,

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:31.960
 like, they're trying to, like, automatically,

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.240
 every, like, little thing.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.080
 I kind of find things for this.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.360
 - Post doing anything good.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.200
 - Yeah.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.400
 - I've been calling them legacy companies,

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.040
 but, I don't know, I gotta find a good new company.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.840
 - It's really, like, it's so parallels.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.720
 Oh, this is gonna sound agist.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.280
 But it's so parallel, like, companies and humans

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:50.760
 are just, like, living organisms are so similar.

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.360
 Like, they, I just always thought, like,

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.240
 companies live forever.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.320
 Have I talked about this with you?

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.280
 There's some book.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.120
 - Yeah, no.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.040
 The company's, like, like, 30-year lifespan

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.400
 once they go public or something like that.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.520
 - Oh, it's even less, I think.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.360
 - Oh, you want to see that?

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.360
 - Oh, it's even less.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.280
 Like, companies die and you just assume

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.840
 all the things you grew up with, like,

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.720
 all the things, you know, we've enjoyed the internet

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.200
 for the last 10 years, that they'll just be here forever,

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.040
 but they won't.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:15.960
 And it's kind of crazy.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.040
 It's rare that companies make it to 50 years

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.120
 and 100 generations of super, yeah.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:20.960
 - Yeah.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:21.800
 - Yeah.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.080
 - I mean, even on, like, a low on a small scale,

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:24.920
 this happens to you, right?

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:29.280
 I know so many situations where someone starts

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.880
 a very successful company.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.720
 And let's say it's, like, a $50 million company.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.240
 I mean, it's like a small business type of company,

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.440
 a consulting company or, like,

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.040
 some kind of local business that reaches that scale.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.880
 And once they retire, nobody in the family

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.320
 really wants to get over it and they just sell it

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.320
 and it just goes away.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:48.200
 So it's hard to make something last past your own life

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.680
 even when you're successful.

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:52.920
 - From the same book, did you know,

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:56.720
 or did you ever think about the fact that cities,

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.520
 cities do live forever?

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.560
 - Oh, so you're talking about that book's scale?

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:01.400
 - Yeah, I am.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.280
 You just guessed based on the few points that I made.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.100
 That's awesome.

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:05.680
 - I guess what I learned when I read this book.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:06.680
 - Are you serious?

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:07.520
 - Yep.

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.360
 - Is it a dumb book?

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.200
 Or is it in the news for being terrible?

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.040
 - No, it's not a dumb book.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.800
 So me and Liz have this really fun relationship

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.840
 where I have only read, like, 10 books.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.120
 Like, I even read a lot of books

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.520
 and I've only read a good one.

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:20.360
 - Yeah.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.280
 - Liz claims I'm under-accounting,

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.700
 but I swear I read, like, 10 books.

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:26.560
 Yes, no, they were not fiction.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:29.640
 The idea, but they were really, really good books.

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:31.160
 And, like, the ideas show up

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.120
 in a lot of other stuff, constantly.

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:37.160
 And so she reads a ton and she summarizes stuff for me.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.120
 And it's amazing 'cause I don't have to read the whole book

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.400
 'cause I have a terrible attendance band

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:41.480
 and I hate reading.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.400
 So she just summarized to me and I can, like,

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.280
 piece it together based off of, like, you know,

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.400
 the knowledge and the 10 books that I have.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:48.880
 And scale is one of the ones she's read.

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.160
 And, yeah, the city's never die thing.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.320
 The whales with the cancer.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.920
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:56.200
 Yeah, it's an interesting book.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.400
 It's funny, as you say that, like,

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.200
 you spend, I just listen to them on Audible.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.880
 I don't really, like, sit down with a physical book.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:02.880
 - Yeah, Liz is the same thing, yeah.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:03.800
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.240
 But, like, you can listen to a book fast

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.240
 and kind of, like, burn through 'em.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.880
 You go on some walks.

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.280
 But, like, eight-hour book, you know,

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:14.080
 that's, I'm gonna say that's an average book on Audible.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.000
 Eight hours.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.800
 And there's, like, three paragraphs of insight.

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.360
 It's all so fluffy.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.280
 Like, you could just read the spark notes or whatever.

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.560
 It wouldn't be the same experience, but, like,

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.520
 you really can just tell somebody, like,

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:28.360
 the gist of a book, and they might as well have read it.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.080
 I guess that's, like, the good part of, like,

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.800
 human knowledge and sharing and the internet.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.560
 It's very quickly, we can all, like,

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.720
 raise the floor for humanity.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.160
 That just got really, like, philosophical or something.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.160
 I'm not that person.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.400
 - That's why I've only read so few books,

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.960
 'cause only so few books that, like, should have been a book

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.160
 and that there's enough ideas in there

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.720
 to tell us a book.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:51.360
 - Now you gotta tell us the books.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.120
 Like, do you remember the 10 specific books?

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.800
 They're just, like-- - Oh, you're embarrassed.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:57.800
 'Cause they're not actually that good.

00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.200
 You just built it up, like, there's--

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.800
 (laughing)

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:04.400
 It's, like, the art of war, then Moby Dick.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.240
 What have you read?

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.880
 Come on, give me a book. - No, okay, let me think.

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:09.920
 So they're not secret.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.280
 They're, like, some of the most popular books ever.

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:13.760
 - Yeah, that's why I figured.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.160
 - Zero to one, of course.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.840
 Everyone can make fun of me for that one.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:18.840
 - A bunch of it to let books.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.480
 I think those are pretty dense.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.200
 They're all pretty unrelated.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.800
 - Oh, yeah.

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.080
 You're one of those guys.

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.160
 Sorry, I'm just learning so much about that.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.160
 - I went through my videos and when you first get on Twitter,

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:29.480
 everyone starts to read the same books.

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.680
 - No, it's just, it's like, people who, like,

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.320
 have read all his books, they sort of, like,

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.440
 they're kind of like a club.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.280
 I don't know.

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:37.120
 They, like, talk about him a lot.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.680
 You don't ever talk about him, though, so interesting.

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:39.520
 Keep going.

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:40.840
 - More books. - No.

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.640
 - Is that it?

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:43.480
 (laughing)

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.320
 - But I do read, when I've read his books,

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.520
 I feel like he's really smart,

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:48.720
 and I feel like you're really smart, so it makes sense.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.520
 - Yeah, people hate his writing style, though,

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.320
 'cause he's, like, such a dick.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.480
 - He is, yeah.

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.120
 - Yeah, but I also love that, unsurprisingly.

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.960
 - He also talks about, like, the fictitious,

00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.360
 like, Frankie and all these people.

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:00.200
 I don't know.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.480
 - He's obsessed with, like, mob culture.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.880
 - Yeah. - He's always, like, yeah.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.080
 - But he seems brilliant.

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:05.920
 He really does.

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.320
 - No, he is super smart,

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.160
 and people get a little bit cynical about him,

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:14.040
 but he's, like, consistently had, like, really good perspectives

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:16.920
 on, like, things across, like, a huge amount of time, so.

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:17.840
 - Do you read fiction books?

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:18.960
 You said, like, non-fiction.

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.560
 Do you read fiction books just for fun?

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:23.800
 - I still don't read that much fiction.

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.840
 I read, like, maybe a couple of years at most.

00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:28.720
 Maybe, like, one or two. - I never read fiction books.

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.280
 So that's, you've read way more.

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.320
 - I read a lot of sci-fi. - Oh, sci-fi.

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:33.680
 Oh, I guess, when I was younger,

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.600
 I read, like, Michael Kriton stuff.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:36.720
 - I always like this stuff.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.360
 Jurassic Park, timeline, or whatever.

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.200
 I've read a few of his books.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.360
 - I didn't read either of those.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.040
 I read, like, there was, like, swarm.

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:47.080
 It was, like, the little nanobot things.

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.600
 It should've made a movie on that one.

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.400
 I mean, Jurassic Park was one of the best movies ever.

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.960
 I don't need to read the book.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.160
 It was, like, so good.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.520
 - Yeah, yeah, so, you know, it's nothing special,

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.480
 and I can't even recall the titles of most of these books.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.560
 You're just, like, I think the reality is you can read

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:04.080
 any 10 books of, like, the most popular books

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.680
 in this category, and, like, it's the same idea

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:06.680
 to show up over and over.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.280
 It's just up to you to, like, internalize them well.

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.480
 - Yeah.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.320
 - But yeah, I think people have a good idea,

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.280
 and they're forced to inflate it into a whole book,

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.720
 'cause otherwise, like, what are you gonna sell for 20 books?

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:16.560
 - Yeah.

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.600
 - But it's, like, usually when I read a book,

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.080
 within the first 30 minutes, I'm, like,

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.000
 convinced of their idea.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.240
 I'm, like, this is a good idea,

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.560
 and I agree with you, and I, and your rights.

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.240
 Then, like, the next seven hours is just them, like,

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.880
 giving you too many examples.

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:29.960
 I'm, like, I'm already convinced.

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:30.800
 I'm already convinced.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:31.640
 I'm already convinced.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:35.280
 So, yeah, it's very few books, I think, should be books.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.320
 I was just thinking, like, if you're an author

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.880
 and you have these ideas,

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.480
 the alternative to writing a book,

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.320
 is just, like, it could have been a Twitter thread.

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.880
 And then I thought, like, somebody should make a Twitter account

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.960
 that just, like, summarizes books, like, a thread per book.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.040
 That would do well. - Sure, that exists.

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.960
 I feel like that's, it would be surprising, yeah.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:51.800
 - Yeah.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:52.640
 I guess it probably does exist.

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.840
 - But, yeah, it's, I think, the next thing I was gonna say,

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.160
 so I was, like, if I ever wrote a book,

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:58.760
 you know what it would be about?

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:02.040
 It would be taking these ideas that show up over and over,

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.000
 and all of these books that are all super popular,

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.040
 everyone's read them, everyone's like, you gotta read them,

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.560
 and everyone says that they've read them.

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:11.960
 I would take, maybe because he had dozens of the best ideas

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:15.880
 from these books, and explain them simply,

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:20.680
 and then explain why literally nobody actually,

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.360
 like, digests this idea correctly,

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.280
 'cause I feel like with all of these books,

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:28.280
 the end advice is, was one true, a lot of was a minute,

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:32.120
 very simple, right, these, it has always properties,

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:34.720
 but very, very difficult to actually implement,

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.200
 and what I've seen with most people is,

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.400
 they'll read these book, these business books, whatever,

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.720
 that are supposed to, like, help you do things better.

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:41.560
 - Yeah.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:42.800
 - And it won't change their behavior,

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.040
 it'll just give them words to rationalize

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.200
 their existing behavior.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:49.400
 People are so good at, like, taking a good idea,

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.200
 and explaining why they're already doing it,

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.400
 versus, like, actually doing it.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.240
 - Yeah.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.080
 - So, I'd love to, like, write a book,

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.640
 just call it, that's called, like, you're doing it wrong,

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.120
 and then just-- - Oh, man.

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.920
 I can see it, Dax, I can see it on the airport shelves.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:04.240
 - I think, like, ultimately, you're really good

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.360
 at distilling stuff and presenting it.

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.760
 I think if you did a book, there was, like, 10 chapters,

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.720
 and there's, like, 10 books, the 10 books you've ever read.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.000
 But, like, each chapter, like you said,

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.840
 does the whole one book, so the whole book would be dense.

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.520
 There would be no fluff. - Yeah.

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.640
 - Because, like, you don't have anything,

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.960
 you don't have, like, one point that you're trying to bolster,

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:27.520
 you just have, like, these 10 major principles or whatever.

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.520
 I love it, I'm sold.

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:32.320
 - 12 rules. - That's actually why I like zero to one,

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:35.120
 because each chapter was, like, I felt like a non-sequitur,

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.320
 it would just be, like, one random idea,

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.160
 then, like, another random idea, and then, like, another reason,

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.520
 because there were a bunch of lectures that were compiled,

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.000
 so it wasn't supposed to be a book.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:42.840
 - Oh, I didn't know that.

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:43.840
 - Yeah, there were a bunch of lectures,

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.480
 and then this guy compiled it,

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:49.760
 and then, recently, that guy ran for a governor in Arizona,

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:53.560
 or something in Arizona, and he was, like, extremely weird,

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:54.560
 and looked like-- (laughs)

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.400
 I honestly, like, looking at the guy recently,

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:59.640
 I feel like I think they cloned Peter Thiel,

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.760
 and, like, improved his genetics.

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:05.240
 He looks like genetically modified Peter Thiel

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:07.560
 that there's spouts off here with the other ideas,

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:08.760
 but, like, he's, like, more handsome,

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:12.160
 and his skin is, like, more, like, is better, I don't know.

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.320
 Sometimes something weird happened there.

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:14.480
 - His skin is better?

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:17.080
 - He just has, like, this, like, really smooth skin,

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:22.080
 and, like, he's taller and skinnier, and it's weird.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:26.160
 - Huh, okay, you need to send this to me after we get off here.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.880
 - His name is Blake Masters.

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:28.720
 That's his name.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.080
 I can't, is that a real name?

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.520
 - Have you heard of Brian Johnson?

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.040
 - That sounds like a fake name, although.

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:35.240
 - That sounds so generic.

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.080
 I hope I got the name right.

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:40.760
 Brian Johnson, he had, like, an exit.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:43.720
 I want to say he sold, like, Venmo or something?

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.640
 No, that's not him.

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.520
 No, that's not the guy.

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:47.920
 Maybe it's not Brian Johnson.

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.560
 He's the guy that spends, like,

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:52.280
 he spends $2 million a year on his body.

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:53.840
 He just, like, is obsessed.

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.000
 - Oh, yes, you didn't have seen him.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.240
 I've seen him. - What's his name?

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:59.360
 Yeah, and he eats, like, in this insane way, and, like...

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:00.200
 - Yeah.

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:03.240
 - He's, like, he's hooked up to all these things all day.

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.080
 Like, sensors.

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.880
 - Yeah, his body looks like he's, like, a 16-year-old.

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.880
 - Yeah, his cellular age is, like...

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:13.680
 It's de-aged by, like, seven years or something stupid like that.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:14.520
 It is Brian Johnson.

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:15.600
 It's just spoke kind of funny.

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.120
 His skin, it made me think of it when you said it's skin.

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:19.120
 His skin, like, glows.

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.360
 He looks like an elf from Lord of the Rings.

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.200
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.040
 - Like, no joke.

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:23.880
 I'm going to send you the picture.

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:24.720
 I'm looking at it right now.

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:25.560
 - He does.

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:27.600
 He looks like he's going to live forever.

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.640
 But then the question is, if you could live forever...

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.240
 - Yes, I'll do it.

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.240
 - For real?

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.240
 - Yeah, in an instant.

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.360
 I'm so afraid of dying.

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:36.640
 - Wait, what?

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.480
 You're afraid of dying?

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.600
 We never talked about this.

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:39.840
 I mean, I guess everyone's afraid of dying.

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.000
 - Yeah, well, because I don't like talking about it.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.080
 - Let's not talk about it.

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:44.280
 You would live forever.

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.600
 'Cause my wife talks about how, like...

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.200
 I don't know, she's just tired sometimes.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.040
 I don't know, that sounds...

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:49.880
 - Yeah, this feels the same way, I think.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:52.080
 - Yeah, it's like, I wouldn't want to live to be 150.

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.840
 That's like, that's so many lifetimes.

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:59.320
 And it's really true, like, life span has increased a ton

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.840
 in the last 100 years, right?

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.160
 I know the whole world's catching up.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:06.560
 Like in the leading nations,

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:10.520
 like the average lifespan, is it doubled?

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:12.720
 From like 50 to 100 in the last 100 years,

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:14.320
 something stupid like that?

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.240
 Not 100, sorry, the life span's not 100,

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.600
 but like people live to be 100.

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.560
 Life span's like 70 something now, I don't know.

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.680
 It went from like 40 to 70, it was something crazy.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.520
 - Yeah.

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:24.960
 - And well, there is that like, what 12 year old thing,

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.240
 which is like, actually, that's 'cause babies were dying

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.640
 and that was bringing down the average.

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:29.720
 - Oh, is that true?

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.600
 So people weren't really dying at 45.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.480
 - I mean, I'm sure it's, yeah, I'm sure it has increased.

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:39.280
 I don't know, like what the literal practical number is.

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:42.720
 - I'm just wondering, like, if our brain is prepared

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.720
 to be alive for 150 years or 120 years or whatever.

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:46.560
 Like...

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:47.400
 - I'm down to find out.

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:48.240
 - Okay.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.080
 - Yeah, like, why not?

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:50.720
 - Well, I mean, some people say, like longevity

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.800
 is just, there's no upper bound,

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:53.880
 we're just gonna keep going.

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:56.560
 - The thing I think about is, what a waste,

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.520
 what a loss it is when someone dies

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:01.000
 in terms of like the resources and stuff

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.360
 that took to get someone to like be born

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.040
 and to like learn everything they learned

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.280
 and like to make all the mistakes

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:09.240
 and eventually become someone with like skill

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:10.600
 and knowledge and wisdom, et cetera.

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:13.040
 And then they just die and then you start over.

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.040
 Like imagine if like Einstein, like another 100 years,

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:16.040
 like I wonder what he would have done

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.840
 and imagine like the greatest people on earth,

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.760
 like if they had like another 100 years of like learning

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:23.400
 and growing, like, I think from that perspective.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.160
 - Interesting, I never thought of it like that.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.000
 - Yeah.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.080
 - I mean, it's also good that like bad people die.

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:30.400
 And they're not around forever, like you can always rely on.

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.200
 - But what is bad, Dax?

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.280
 What is a bad, what is a bad person?

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:36.680
 - I don't know.

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:37.520
 I mean, no, I don't know.

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:38.360
 I know what you're talking about.

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:39.400
 I don't know why that's the question.

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:40.240
 (laughing)

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.080
 - I think I just started trying.

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.520
 - I don't know, it's good that you died.

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:43.320
 - Yeah, yeah, okay.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:44.400
 Okay, there's bad.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.640
 I don't know where I was saying over there.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.360
 This is, we've been all over the place.

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:50.520
 This one, I don't know, this has made a tough title.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.560
 - Well, I got one more thing to talk about.

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:53.400
 - Okay.

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:54.240
 - Well, we actually talked about it earlier

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:55.200
 'cause we were talking about Twitch,

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.160
 but speaking of companies that are just like messing up,

00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.960
 did you see all the Reddit API stuff?

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:00.800
 - No.

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.840
 - So Reddit, some app developed,

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.080
 I didn't look into the details.

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.520
 So I don't know what these numbers actually translate to,

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:09.680
 but he builds a very popular third party app for Reddit,

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.480
 which is important because Reddit sucks in so many ways.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.600
 So third party apps are very popular.

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:17.600
 Reddit told him it's gonna cost him $20 million a year

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.080
 to continue using the API.

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:19.920
 - Yeah.

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:20.920
 What was the app?

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:23.360
 - I don't remember.

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:26.880
 - 'Cause I've got a friend who, he worked at Zapier.

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:27.880
 Zapier?

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:28.720
 Zapier?

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:29.560
 - I don't know.

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:31.400
 I figure Zapier 'cause they're called Zaps.

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:32.640
 - Oh yeah, okay, Zapier.

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.520
 So we worked together, his name's Grant.

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:37.840
 And he left Zapier because his, it's called Postpone.

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:40.440
 His like Reddit scheduling tool was like making

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.680
 as much as his salary and like he's doing really well with it.

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.880
 But if, I don't know if he's gonna start paying

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.320
 a ton in the API, I'd love to know.

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:47.160
 - Yeah.

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.200
 So it's like another example of like Twitter,

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.440
 like companies trying to clamp down on their API.

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:53.840
 And again, this is a really great example of,

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:55.280
 I kind of find the right word for this.

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:57.960
 Like a company hits their peak.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.400
 And from there, it just, the only level where the company

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.040
 are a bunch of like micro-optimizers,

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:03.440
 like they just shut it like,

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:05.040
 cling on to what they have and like,

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:06.400
 eke out every dollar from it.

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:09.200
 'Cause they know that they are just not capable of

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:12.360
 ever creating anything bigger or better or newer.

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:13.760
 - It's so weird.

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:16.920
 Like I don't understand the principles

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:20.400
 that like why big companies can't keep doing cool things.

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.680
 Can't they just hire a bunch of people

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:24.080
 who've never done anything to come in and do their first thing?

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.400
 Why is it everybody gets one first thing?

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.920
 - I don't think, I think the issue is that

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.960
 there's all these forces that show up

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.680
 once you're starting to be successful,

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:36.920
 that push you into becoming a quote unquote grown up company.

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:39.640
 But these things also guarantee that

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:42.680
 you're just hit your maximum and you're gonna go past that.

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:46.040
 Like, yeah, I think the issue is most of the world

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:49.680
 is represented by this category of person.

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.160
 So I think that becomes successful.

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.760
 Eventually, those people are gonna outnumber you.

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:53.600
 They show up all around you.

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:54.680
 They start to work at your company

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:55.600
 and start to pull you in a different way.

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:58.880
 So yeah, I think that's why you see founders leave,

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:01.480
 like the Reddit founder hasn't been there in forever.

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:02.320
 - Ah, yeah.

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.160
 - So again, this is another situation where it's like,

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:08.040
 I think to anyone that's like in like a builder mindset,

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:13.040
 like you would never make a practice hard or charge for it.

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.040
 - Right.

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.960
 - Anyone building a cool thing,

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:18.080
 cynically it's, they're doing private research for you.

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.040
 You can just snipe their features and put them in

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.560
 once they've outdated it.

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:24.360
 And two, like it's such like a boost

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.640
 to your ecosystem and your audience and everything.

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:29.800
 And that should overpower the fact that,

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.760
 oh, technically we can make a couple million dollars

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.400
 if we start charging this.

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.080
 But yeah, I think once you reach certain points,

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.640
 people just don't have any ideas for anything new.

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.120
 So they're just like, well, that all we have

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.520
 is to start charging for API if we wanna make more money.

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:43.800
 So they're just the signals that you start to get

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:45.280
 from companies you know they're never really gonna do

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:46.240
 anything great again.

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.080
 - Yeah.

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:49.960
 - And Rhett's been that way for a long time with like,

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:51.440
 I like to have stopped, I used to use them a lot.

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.600
 I haven't used them much at all in like the past five years.

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:54.880
 - Yeah, I don't really use Reddit.

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.880
 The only time I've ever been on Reddit is like,

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.040
 oh, when I did something really cool,

00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.400
 I wanna put it on Reddit.

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:01.200
 And then everybody's like, you can't do that.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.200
 You can't just pop in here and put something cool.

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:06.480
 You gotta like be a member, a community member,

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:07.760
 an upstanding citizen.

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:09.200
 How'd you feel about this one?

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.040
 - I think it's good.

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.560
 I don't mind when we cover all sorts of things

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:12.400
 and go all over the place.

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.240
 - I don't either.

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.080
 I don't really care.

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:15.040
 - It's really a nice little roller coaster

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:16.680
 for everyone, never know what to expect.

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:18.000
 - I wish I could just name the title.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.160
 I would like if there's like a random episode namer tool.

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:25.080
 I just don't even wanna make the name of the episodes

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:27.320
 be topical, wouldn't that be fun?

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.760
 So it's just like banana sandwich.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:33.200
 - Oh, yeah, like we picked a theme.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.280
 - Oh sure, a theme.

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:36.280
 I meant like literally random words.

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:37.120
 I don't know.

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:37.960
 - Interesting.

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:38.800
 - I like that.

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:39.640
 - A theme could be good.

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:42.360
 Like what is there like a hundred million of, yeah?

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.200
 - Or okay, a million.

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.600
 Yeah, that's a little more ambitious.

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:48.320
 - Actually, no, I do think the title is kind of,

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.160
 I can see people benefiting from the title.

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.200
 - Okay, well you're not.

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:52.040
 - Any fun.

00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:52.880
 - There you go.

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:53.880
 - If you're trying to find the episode

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:55.640
 where we talked about replica actually,

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:56.480
 it's nice that there's this.

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.360
 - I guess, yeah, I guess.

00:28:58.360 --> 00:28:59.560
 We should really put our transcript.

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:01.560
 Okay, this is getting off the rails.

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:02.960
 We should probably end this.

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:03.800
 - I was gonna say we should put,

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:04.760
 we should actually have a transcript

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:07.360
 and put it on the website.

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.200
 I don't know.

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:09.720
 - Is that not something Transistor already does?

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:11.080
 - I don't think so.

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:12.680
 That has a place where you can upload one.

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:14.560
 I feel like transcription, okay, we gotta stop.

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:15.400
 We gotta stop.

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:16.320
 We're about to start it up again.

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:17.600
 - Up, stop, stop it.

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:18.680
 - Bye.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:19.520
 - Bye.

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:22.100
 (upbeat music)
