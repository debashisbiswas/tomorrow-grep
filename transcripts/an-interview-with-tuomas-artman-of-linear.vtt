WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:25.100
 So for those of you that know me,

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.020
 I have probably mentioned linear once, twice,

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.020
 maybe five dozen times.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.180
 It is a product that I've been obsessed with

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.440
 for several years.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.980
 One, and for two reasons, really.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.340
 The first one being the business is fairly interesting.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.700
 I think they took a strategy that is pretty counter

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.540
 to what most of the advice that you hear today is.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.740
 And it's influenced pretty much everything I do.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.860
 And then two, I believe that it's actually

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.980
 probably the best web app that I have ever seen.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.220
 I have far margin, particularly because they use

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.140
 a fairly unique architecture that is not really well known

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.460
 and is quite different from where, like the status quo

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.700
 and what generally web developers think about.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.340
 So with that teaser, I'd like to welcome

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.820
 Tomas Artman, co-founder and CTO of linear.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.660
 How are you doing today?

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.140
 - Doing good. Thanks so much for having me.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.060
 - For those of you that don't know,

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.140
 linear is a project management tool.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.780
 And this is not a unique idea every developer in the world

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.780
 has probably at some point hated their project management

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.620
 tool has had an idea to start a new one.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.060
 There are dozens, if not, and maybe 100,

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.540
 I don't know what the market size is.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.140
 Not a unique idea at all.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.900
 So it feels weird to start a company saying,

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.100
 I am going to build yet another project management tool.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.980
 And it's shocking to see that that actually

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.060
 was quite successful.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.820
 So I'd love to hear about the original,

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.100
 kind of at the beginning, when you chose to find a company,

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.180
 what was the mindset?

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.540
 How are you guys thinking about it?

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.740
 - It was actually pretty interesting.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.340
 It took us a while to sort of get behind the idea

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.220
 of doing project management or software for project management.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.820
 'Cause ultimately, like in the beginning,

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.700
 we thought it was a pretty boring space to be in.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.460
 Like the founders, we all came from sort of consumer companies.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.500
 I was working at Uber back in the day.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.900
 Jory was at Coinbase and Kari was at Airbnb.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.180
 And we started talking probably like six years ago now

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.460
 with Jory about sort of the state of issue tracking

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.780
 and project management at all of these companies.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.380
 I think Uber was using Fabricator for sort of engineering.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.260
 They were moving, essentially over to Jira,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.620
 just after I left.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.140
 Coinbase was using, I think, GitHub issues,

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.700
 but moved over to Jira as well pretty quickly.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.700
 And Airbnb was on Jira from the get-go.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.660
 And so I think it was me and Jory

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.380
 who started talking about sort of like the sense

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.060
 that we have gotten from the state of project management

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.580
 at these product companies.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.020
 And we sort of felt that ICs really didn't enjoy

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.380
 and didn't like what they were using.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.380
 And it was usually mandated by sort of product management

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.140
 or project managers or middle management.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.820
 And then sort of engineers in your ICs

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.340
 just had to use whatever tool the middle management

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.820
 came up with.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.060
 And we continued hearing from all these different companies

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.220
 that we just randomly chatted with

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.220
 that ICs really were underserved by the issue tracking needs

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.740
 or by the needs of their project management.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.580
 Like two ICs project management is very different

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.580
 than for your product managers or managers per se

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.980
 'cause you're just working off of a list of things

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:52.980
 that you need to do.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.900
 So your visibility and your sort of interaction

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.980
 with the tool is much more constrained

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.740
 than when you're planning out what you wanna build

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:02.740
 at a large company.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.620
 And it seemed to us that none of the existing tools

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.260
 were really servicing the market of ICs.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.180
 And for the longest time we're just sort of wondering

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.020
 about why nobody has tackled the market

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.020
 from the side of the IC.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.700
 Why nobody has come up with a tool for ICs

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.740
 and tool that ICs will be happy to use.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.460
 And it seemed like sort of a great market opportunity

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.420
 and great opportunity to build something

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.660
 you would immediately have quite a few customers

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.820
 in the smaller segment.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.700
 Like if you started targeting smaller startups

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.540
 or companies with less than 50 employees,

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.660
 you would sort of be able to quite quickly

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.060
 come up with a product that would be useful for them.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.860
 And it took us a while to actually jump on this

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.060
 'cause as I said, like we found the idea

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.540
 of working on project management for the next years,

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.700
 quite boring.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.460
 And the space itself wasn't really enticing to us.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.700
 And even more when we talked with Kari,

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.020
 Kari was even more sort of not very interested

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.380
 in the space being a designer himself.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.340
 But I don't know what's led to the realization

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.580
 but we at some point understood that it's not really

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.180
 about project management or issue tracking or any of that.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.900
 There's an underlying mission behind

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.020
 sort of what we actually wanted to achieve

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.020
 which was helping product companies

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.180
 be better at building and shipping product.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.940
 And that felt like something that we could sink our teeth

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.220
 into and that we felt was much more interesting

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.420
 and was a mission that we could get behind

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:47.100
 and work on for the next 10 or so years.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.020
 And with that realization, we started sort of

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.140
 to sink our teeth into issue tracking at first

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.940
 'cause again, that's the way to get to the market

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.780
 is to build an issue tracker

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.340
 'cause you immediately had all the smaller startups

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.580
 that would enjoy using the products and where

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:06.900
 the product could be useful.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.460
 And once you started working with the startups,

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.580
 those people are usually very vocal

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.460
 and you can sort of easily chat with them

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.940
 and sort of understand, get understanding what they need

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.460
 and startups hopefully grow as time passes.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.740
 So as they grow, so that's our functionality

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.700
 and features that need to grow as well.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.220
 So from the start, I think we call ourselves

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.740
 an issue tracker for the first two years of our existence.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.540
 But if you always knew that we wanted to do something,

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.420
 something different, something more than project management,

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.340
 issue tracking and even something more than project

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:46.260
 management, we wanted to change how companies build product.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.300
 And in a sense, that was sort of a selfish

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.820
 selfish mission as well 'cause we're users of software

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.180
 and we sort of have these pivotal moments in our lives

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.820
 when we've used new hardware or new software

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.580
 that has literally changed our lives

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.620
 like the first time we saw iOS for example

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.100
 and used iOS ourselves felt super magical.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.980
 Not so much in the recent 10 years,

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.460
 like we don't think much has happened.

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.340
 I don't know why, but maybe it is because, yeah,

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:20.380
 people have become less good at building products

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:24.340
 or trying to do new things.

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.100
 And we just thought that if you can build an issue tracker

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.180
 that feels magical and feels like an application

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.180
 that people would look up to, then there's really no reason

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:37.220
 for anybody else to sort of do something less good.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.340
 If your issue tracker is something that you enjoy using

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.740
 and that you look up to as a piece of software,

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.540
 then hopefully that is a motivation for you as well

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:46.780
 to build better software.

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:50.460
 - Yeah, and I can't understand how true that ended up being.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:55.460
 Like I said, we started, so prior to using linear

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.220
 for everything, the initial point you made about

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.780
 a lack of focus on ICs is a really good one.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.700
 I tried a bunch of tools and we actually settled

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:07.380
 on just using Airtable because we couldn't really find a tool

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:11.980
 that as an IC, typically what you wanna see is you wake up,

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.220
 you see the list of tasks for you in like a very clear way

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:15.260
 and you can not come out.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.700
 And then as someone that's in a different role,

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.300
 you need to see like a cross and plan across people

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.100
 and you're right, like very few tools really just thought

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.740
 about it in that simple way.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:25.060
 And we just ended up using Airtable

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:27.340
 because we were able to create the views that we needed

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.980
 for the project managers and the views that we needed

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.100
 for the day-to-day.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.860
 So finding linear was excellent

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:38.020
 'cause it kind of served exactly those two purposes.

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.780
 And yeah, like once we started using it,

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.820
 I was like, this tool is so good.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:45.420
 Why have I never cared about all these little details

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:46.260
 that they got right?

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.180
 And my software just kind of became better.

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:50.940
 Like once you see it, you can't unsee it.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:51.940
 Now that I know that it exists,

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.580
 like am I really gonna not shoot for something

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:55.460
 of that quality?

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:58.380
 So yeah, I don't know why it hasn't been as common,

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.980
 but it might be as simple as like just people

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.780
 just weren't thinking about it.

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:03.940
 And now that they're thinking about it,

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.060
 there's kind of like a breakthrough.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.100
 So yeah, I think that intention has only been successful.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:13.340
 - Yeah, I know it's easy to sort of, you know, not know

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.700
 or not care about the user experience.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.420
 Like when you're looking for product market fit,

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.660
 like you're not, you don't want to sort of, you know,

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.500
 spend your time, you know, polishing the product

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.260
 when you don't know if you're gonna succeed or not.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.460
 And, you know, maybe that then becomes sort of the norm

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.780
 where like, because you never have cared, you know,

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:32.700
 too much about this bit and polish of your product.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.580
 You just, you know, don't remember to do it once you actually

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.580
 have a following and moment you have users.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.020
 - Yeah, that's actually exactly what I was referring

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.580
 to the beginning.

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.460
 The level of detail and polish that linear has

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.380
 is quite opposite to most advice that you get, right?

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:48.900
 You know, don't waste time on that stuff

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.180
 when you don't even know if your business

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:51.460
 is gonna be successful.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:54.020
 But what's different about linear is

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:56.260
 that is the differentiator, right?

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:57.940
 Of course, there's a lot more than just that.

00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:59.180
 There's a lot of thought into the product,

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.340
 but a key differentiator and key advantage

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:06.060
 and key edge that you have is the fact that it's very good.

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.900
 And I think prior to me seeing linear,

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:11.180
 I never realized that that could just be the thing

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.620
 that you differentiate on.

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.260
 Did you guys realize that very early on?

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.180
 Like was that intentionally the initial pitch?

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.340
 Like when you were pitching investors, et cetera.

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:19.820
 And did people understand that?

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.260
 That was literally the reason why we started linear.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.500
 Like just like the market existed.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:27.180
 Like we weren't inventing anything new.

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:30.540
 Like Jira had been around for 20 years at that point already.

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:32.020
 And there were like, you know,

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:35.140
 hundreds of different project management tools.

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:38.380
 And our, you know, idea from the get go

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:42.100
 was just to be better, like, you know,

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:45.740
 better to the user, better as a user experience,

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.220
 better in all kinds of things.

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.820
 And, you know, we care deeply about the product,

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.700
 like, you know, the founders.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.460
 Like we've always sort of, you know,

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:57.900
 have been interested in design and good UX and all of that.

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.460
 And, you know, part of our careers have been built on that as well.

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:04.660
 So it was sort of, you know, easy to get started with that.

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:07.300
 And like I do remember, like when we started,

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:10.060
 like we started prototyping just on the weekends

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:13.340
 on, you know, what would an issue tracker look like.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.500
 And we still have the history of like the first ticket

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.780
 that we, or the first, first issue that we put into linear,

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:21.620
 it was sort of built the command menu,

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:24.740
 which is kind of silly thing to do if you don't have a product,

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.860
 like, you know, start with building out a command menu.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:30.300
 But we were, you know, keen on figuring out

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:33.220
 whether we can build something on the web that felt,

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:34.660
 you know, more like an application.

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.700
 And obviously superhuman was out back then.

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.420
 That was a big inspiration for us to look at their command menu,

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.940
 keyboard shortcuts and, you know,

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:46.500
 try to build something that felt like a true native application

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.300
 on the web.

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.820
 And yeah, like from the get go, we knew that, you know,

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:52.300
 we weren't, you know, building anything new,

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:57.380
 but the way for us to win the market would be to just be better.

00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:00.580
 So pens sort of the focus on quality and UX.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:03.060
 - So I don't know when you started raising money,

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:06.180
 but in the process, in the early process of pitching

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:09.580
 and explaining that, did investors understand that concept

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.140
 or did it seem like we were able to show something

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:15.260
 to prove that or did they kind of have to go on your word?

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.820
 - I mean, we had an easy time raising money.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:21.140
 Like, I keep on saying that, you know,

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:24.540
 the experience of building linear has been a very, you know,

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:25.740
 easy and different one.

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:29.340
 Like usually, you know, startup comes with ups and downs.

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:31.300
 We've been just sort of coasting upwards.

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:32.940
 Like there have been no sort of, you know,

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:35.260
 bigger problems or challenges to begin with,

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:36.460
 which is, you know, super strange.

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:40.220
 Like I think we got, you know, just, you know, hugely lucky.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:43.820
 So yeah, like our fundraising for a seed round

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:46.380
 was, you know, literally just a few weeks.

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:49.300
 And it was not of our own accord.

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:50.940
 Like we initially didn't want to raise money,

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:53.220
 like we wanted to build, essentially a prototype,

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:55.100
 you know, just bootstrap it, get a few customers

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:59.020
 and have a product that sort of, you know,

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:02.140
 exemplified on what we want to build.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:05.940
 And then, you know, if need be, go ahead and raise money.

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:09.140
 But, you know, as it turned out, Sequoia,

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:11.340
 sort of, you know, was scouring through LinkedIn

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.660
 and sort of found out that, you know, you know,

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:15.980
 one guy from Uber and one from Airbnb

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:17.980
 and one from Kanye's have founded the company.

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.500
 And they've, you know, put out a blog post

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.900
 and, you know, Twitter is, you know, a bit abuzz about,

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:24.060
 you know, what they're building.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:26.900
 So they reached out to us and then sort of was, you know,

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:31.660
 rather quick at sort of, you know, getting the seed in.

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:34.460
 So we didn't really have to explain too much,

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:36.900
 or, you know, show the product because we, you know,

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.900
 back then, we didn't have anything to show for.

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.340
 Like, yeah, we did have a few prototypes.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:44.100
 We did have a few designs.

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.780
 And I'm sure Kari put them on the deck.

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:48.700
 But it was very early.

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:51.300
 But, you know, I think they, you know,

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.460
 believed in the same vision of, like, you know,

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.100
 first targeting ICs, building an upwards from there

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.980
 and just building a product that people enjoy using.

00:13:58.980 --> 00:13:59.820
 - Cool.

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:01.540
 So switching gears, something else that you said.

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:04.060
 So a key part of building something like linear is,

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:05.180
 it's not just a product.

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:08.020
 You also need to think about what your opinion

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:10.100
 on the right way to build products is.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:14.300
 And you kind of bake some of that philosophy into products.

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:15.900
 And I think linear also has like,

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:16.900
 I forgot what you guys call it.

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:20.260
 You have like an actual document with the linear approaches.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:21.100
 What was it?

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:21.940
 Remember what it was called?

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:23.260
 - Yeah, we have the linear method.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.300
 - Linear method, exactly.

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:28.220
 Was that something you discovered as you built the product

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.700
 or upfront, did you guys kind of all like find alignment on,

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:32.540
 on that?

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.220
 - The method itself was something,

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:35.060
 and it's still in flux.

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:37.180
 Like we haven't completed the method yet.

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:40.020
 Like it's something that we someday want to,

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:42.420
 want to finish up and get closure on.

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:46.980
 But in the beginning, like, we did have this idea of like,

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:50.220
 you know, we don't want to build just a product.

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:53.060
 Like we want to have some sort of, you know,

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.060
 mission statement or idea or methodology behind it.

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:59.020
 And that same came from the, from the,

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:01.460
 from the insight that we had when, you know,

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.180
 we were working at these, these larger companies

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:04.460
 that people looked up to when they,

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.740
 when they were building products.

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.700
 And you sort of all realized that, you know,

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:12.820
 none of the internal teams really knew how to build product

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:14.260
 or what the methodology was.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.100
 Like everybody, you know, depending on team,

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.300
 you usually use something akin to scrum.

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:21.020
 And when you ask people like, you know,

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:23.860
 why, why are you using scrum or why you're sprinting?

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:26.340
 You know, people wouldn't really know what the answer was.

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:27.620
 And they were like, no, I don't know.

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:28.540
 Everybody does it like this.

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:31.900
 So I guess, you know, it's, it's for development.

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.180
 So it makes sense.

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.220
 And I thought, well, it always wanted to range that, you know,

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:37.580
 scrum has been invented for a very different world.

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.700
 Like scrum, it actually was, was made when you had sort

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:43.500
 of a non-technical customer and a technical team.

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.020
 And the non-technical customer wanted working software

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:47.340
 from the technical team.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:49.660
 And the technical team didn't want the customer to sort

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:51.860
 of get involved when they were actually working on stuff.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:54.980
 And so, you know, you came up with this with this framework

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:57.460
 that worked for both companies before the customer

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:58.820
 and the technical team.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:00.460
 And, you know, every four weeks or so,

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:02.500
 the customer would get something out of it.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:04.980
 And for the rest of the time, the customer would sort of,

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:08.500
 you know, give the, give the team space to implement

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.820
 whatever, you know, was asked for.

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:13.340
 And that's not how product companies work nowadays anymore.

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:16.100
 Like there sort of needs to be a different,

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.220
 different way of building product that makes much more sense

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:22.540
 for the, for the, for the current world where like you have

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:25.500
 integrated teams within the company building their own software.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.900
 - Yeah. And especially at smaller companies,

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:31.300
 this thing where it's a good point about the customer

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.580
 not being super involved, like kind of giving space.

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:35.380
 And that's what it was designed for.

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:38.460
 This is exactly the issue I had with a lot of the approach

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:42.020
 earlier in my career with companies that are building software.

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:45.340
 You would plan out something like some kind of like long,

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:48.460
 longer-term thing we're going to do exactly X, Y, and Z things.

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:51.020
 And then three days later, your customer,

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:53.260
 you would have an interaction with the customer

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.300
 and you would get suddenly really excited to solve some problem

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:57.460
 that wasn't on your roadmap.

00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:59.220
 Because when you're not, when you're not talking about your

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:01.460
 customers, all issues kind of seem equal.

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:03.700
 But the moment like someone has a problem,

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:05.740
 suddenly an issue is like the top of your mind.

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:09.500
 So yeah, having that flexibility, I think the reality is,

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.860
 and I've only ever worked at really, really stage companies.

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:15.260
 It's very hard to know what you're going to be excited about

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:16.100
 week to week.

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:18.220
 So a lot of these tools were about like locking in

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:19.780
 these long-term plans.

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:23.420
 And I found that that almost never, never really worked out.

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:27.060
 And it's almost like building it water-fully,

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:29.220
 which was what Scrum--

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:30.380
 Wasn't supposed to not do.

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:32.980
 In the beginning, but yeah, it was trying to avoid.

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:34.540
 Yeah, yeah, maybe my experience as well.

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:36.860
 Everyone is doing agile, but if you actually look at what

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:39.500
 they're doing, it's like, yeah, it's entirely a waterfall

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:40.860
 process.

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:43.580
 Yeah, so I think that's really awesome where there's like a

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:47.180
 whole document teaching you how to build product.

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:50.700
 So the three of you came from at least the last--

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:53.380
 I'm sure you've had other experience before, but the

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:56.380
 last job you were at prior to founding this was at bigger

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:57.660
 companies.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.700
 So when you're kind of developing this method, did you feel

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:04.180
 like there is a trade-off with what works, smart companies,

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:05.300
 what works in bigger companies?

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:07.620
 Or do you generally find that there actually is a good

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.700
 approach that works pretty well for everyone?

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:13.300
 I mean, no approach works the same for everybody.

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:18.380
 And I think people, when they look at the linear method and

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:22.580
 what we've described there, it is common sense stuff.

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:26.300
 It is not very descriptive for the plain reason that you

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:30.940
 have to take it and sort of make it your own, because no

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:33.660
 companies is alike.

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:38.020
 But the idea was that there's nothing inherently in building

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:41.740
 a product that would be different at a large company

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:42.620
 and a small company.

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:47.500
 I think the method and the way of working still works

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:52.940
 regardless of size, rather than getting teams of hundreds

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:56.860
 of engineers, companies tend to break up teams into smaller

00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:01.540
 pieces and work on functionality individually.

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:04.020
 So if you have a small company, just have less stuff that

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.420
 you're working on at the moment.

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:07.700
 If you have a larger company, you've got more initiatives,

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:11.420
 but they need to themselves work in the same way.

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:12.620
 Yeah, that makes sense.

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:17.420
 Yeah, because I think a lot of times when companies see how

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:20.780
 a smaller company operates, they might think that could never

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:24.420
 work for us, because we're big, or they'll have some reason.

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:27.420
 But I think I've found that, yes, it's not exactly the same,

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:29.060
 but roughly the principles are the same.

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.700
 It's usually the low level principles that you need to get

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:32.020
 right.

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:35.180
 And when things are broken, it's usually not--

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:39.020
 it's true because you're not following some of those ideas.

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:42.700
 So that's a lot on linear as a business, the product.

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:44.780
 But my audience is mostly engineers.

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:47.140
 I'm trying to get them thinking more about those things.

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:50.020
 I'd love to talk about stuff in that category.

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:53.740
 But let's get into some of the technical details, right?

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:56.660
 With linear, when you're using the product,

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:59.860
 every interaction you do is near instant.

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:01.700
 Or it's the answer you probably can't tell.

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:05.020
 So whether that's something simple, like marking an issue

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:06.660
 is done, or something more complicated,

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:09.700
 like searching through all your open issues, every key

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:11.020
 stroke, instant response.

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:12.860
 And I think I remember initially the landing page--

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:14.940
 or at some point, landing page, like, very clearly said there.

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:17.060
 Maybe you continue to say that.

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:18.540
 When was that, like, the perspective?

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:20.500
 When did you guys decide that that was the perspective you

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:20.820
 wanted?

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:21.820
 That was a good rule.

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:25.340
 You needed to have instant reaction times, everything.

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:28.580
 Again, from the get-go, before we even started working

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:32.060
 on anything, the way we started prototyping

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:37.620
 and issue tracker were the first sort of prototype of linear.

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:42.060
 I had spent, I don't know, eight, nine years working on mobile.

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:45.420
 And I was totally burned out by mobile native engineering.

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:50.020
 Even before we decided to start working on the linear,

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:53.060
 I took a few weekends to sort of double with web technologies,

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:55.460
 which I had sort of done 10 years prior.

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:57.980
 But a lot of stuff had happened in between.

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:03.420
 And I was totally unaware of technology stack of web

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:04.900
 when I started going around.

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:08.980
 And I had done a few sort of synchronization engines before.

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:11.540
 And just thinking about the idea of if you had an issue

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:15.420
 tracker, what would you want it to be?

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:21.420
 And I always wanted to build an application that

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:24.460
 was fully built on a synchronization stack.

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:25.620
 I tried it at Uber.

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:28.900
 When I joined Uber, I built a synchronization engine for them.

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:30.020
 I was a bit too late.

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:32.100
 Like the company was hyper-growing.

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.820
 We did have sort of a Swift client and a Java client

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:38.660
 and a JavaScript client out and a go implementation

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:41.380
 for the server to do full synchronization on the Uber stack.

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:43.340
 But the company was just going so fast.

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:46.060
 And nobody else sort of shared the same mission.

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:49.100
 So I wasn't able to sort of push it through.

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:51.700
 To this day, I still think that Uber would have been much

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:54.740
 better off if they had adopted some sort of sync technology.

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:56.700
 Because for the next three years, they

00:21:56.700 --> 00:22:02.380
 were sort of trying to do something similar with much

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:05.460
 various results, and something that just took them

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:06.460
 a long time to do.

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:08.140
 Because it wasn't natively built in

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:10.260
 into any of the mobile stacks.

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:12.820
 So I had this idea that the next project that I

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:19.900
 wanted to be mobile or be web, I wanted to do it on sync.

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:23.180
 So when I started toying around with this issue tracker

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:26.500
 in my back head, I just wanted to try out

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.300
 synchronization technologies on the web.

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:32.340
 And that was literally the first sort of prototype

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:35.060
 that I did, like how can I do sort of a very simple issue

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:37.940
 tracker that was real-time synchronous across multiple clients.

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:41.820
 And when we saw it, it was Jory and I sort of hacking

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:44.260
 on these things back in the day.

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:45.860
 And when we saw it working, it just

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:48.180
 thought, you know, absolutely fantastic.

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:50.460
 And you could imagine, like, you know,

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:53.820
 with synchronization, like, you can be in an offline state,

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:55.620
 like, where every single operation essentially

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:58.100
 happens on the client, and then sort of the transactions

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:01.580
 get sent out to the server, you know, behind the scenes.

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:03.580
 And if you can build your application in a way where

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:06.340
 every operation is optimistic, where sort of the client

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:09.180
 can fathom that, you know, this operation will succeed

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:12.420
 on the back end, then you can be optimistic on the client as well.

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:14.340
 So when you do an operation on the client,

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:16.340
 you can already apply it on the local state

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:19.260
 and, you know, present the view as it will be, you know,

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:22.740
 a few seconds from now when the server accepts this change,

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:25.180
 because so few transactions actually, you know,

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:28.180
 get reverted on the back end.

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.860
 And with that in mind, like, we were able to build a sort

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:36.020
 of a quick prototype that just showed how quick, you know,

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:37.220
 your application can be.

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:39.260
 When you start building out things, like, everything is fast,

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:41.060
 right, like, your first program will always be fast

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:43.420
 because you run it on your local computer.

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:46.180
 But we sort of knew that, you know, the speed

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:49.140
 won't really drop from here, like, the architecture itself,

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:52.100
 lend itself to be real-time always, right,

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:54.060
 regardless of how much data you had

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:56.100
 or how big your application grew.

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:58.540
 And we just thought that, you know,

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:02.780
 that was the best user experience that you could build.

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:04.620
 And starting with the idea, like, you know,

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:06.340
 once we started working on a linear,

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:07.940
 like, we knew that we just, you know,

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:09.220
 needed to build something better.

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:10.780
 So it was sort of an obvious choice to go

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:12.780
 with full synchronization.

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:14.180
 So that we could build an application

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:15.300
 that was just super fast.

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:17.580
 - Yeah, so just for clarity for people

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:20.580
 that are just not in the context.

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:24.780
 So when you say syncing, this is a architecture pattern

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:27.620
 that linear follows, where a large portion

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:30.260
 of your working set of data is actually synced locally

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:32.420
 so that all the operations are happening locally.

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:34.780
 So when you're doing search, it's searching

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:36.940
 off of what's in your browser.

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:40.020
 It's not making remote calls every time you press a keystroke.

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:43.300
 And this applies to, you know, all the actions that you take.

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:44.740
 It's a very different architecture.

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:48.140
 I think I've seen it now called as a local first architecture.

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:49.380
 I think it's different than like,

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:53.100
 I think people conflate this with like offline apps.

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:54.740
 I don't think linear is really meant to be used

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:55.580
 like fully offline.

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:57.140
 I'm sure a lot of it will work.

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:59.780
 But it's not really for the use it

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:00.860
 when you don't have internet reason.

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:05.140
 It's more for, if you can sync a large set of the data locally,

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:07.700
 everything can be really, really fast

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:08.900
 because there's no remote call.

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:11.580
 And it doesn't matter if your server is potentially slow

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:14.260
 or if you have a lot of different users on your server.

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:16.380
 Most operations are hitting it asynchronously.

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:19.660
 And that's kind of the idea behind the sync engine.

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:21.500
 I think you guys call it, right?

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:24.740
 And I've seen this pattern show up more,

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:27.820
 but it's still rarely deployed.

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:29.460
 I think there's very few applications I see

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:31.540
 that takes approach.

00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:36.700
 And I think oftentimes when I describe it to people,

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:38.820
 they immediately think that can't work.

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:40.020
 Like there's no way that could work

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:42.140
 or like sync the whole day is that locally,

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:44.380
 what do you mean, that's like too much data?

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:46.340
 So do you have any thoughts on kind of

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:48.020
 like that initial reaction that people have?

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:49.980
 - Yeah, I mean, it totally depends on your application

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:51.180
 whether it can work or not.

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.580
 Like, you know, local first or sync

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:55.700
 or whatever you wanna call it.

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:59.380
 Works for when you have a finite set of data

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:03.380
 that you can load to the clients almost fully.

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:05.020
 Like we started with a full synchronization.

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:08.260
 Like when the client would put it for the first time,

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:10.780
 they would load the entire state of that workspace locally.

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:12.980
 And it worked for two or three years.

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:14.660
 And then we got sort of bigger customers

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:16.580
 where we couldn't load the entire data set anymore

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:20.980
 because it was 200, 300 megabytes of data.

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:22.980
 So we had to sort of implement something

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:26.860
 that still felt like you had all the data locally

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:29.460
 from sort of the engineer's perspective,

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:31.860
 but behind the scenes we would sort of stream data

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:34.020
 in if needed.

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:38.740
 But like, yeah, if you wanna do, I don't know,

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:42.220
 like an application with a lot of data

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:44.220
 that sort of changes all the time

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:48.460
 that synchronization probably isn't the best use case

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:49.300
 for you.

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:50.180
 But if you have a finite set of data,

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:53.500
 like if you're working on what you normally,

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:56.660
 or 20 years ago would have built as a sort of

00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:59.780
 desktop application that had sort of a remote backend

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.380
 where you would then store the data

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:03.300
 or synchronize the data to.

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:07.620
 Then yes, synchronization can definitely work for you.

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:10.060
 The one thing that sort of we got surprised

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:14.620
 as ourselves as well was like the benefit of it.

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:16.100
 Like we initially thought that, you know,

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:17.580
 the user would get the benefit.

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:18.740
 The user would sort of, you know,

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:20.700
 get an application that was super fast and they did.

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:23.500
 But I think like the biggest benefit for us as a company

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:25.700
 was that we were just, you know,

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:27.860
 extremely quick at, you know,

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:29.580
 iterating on the product itself.

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:32.140
 'Cause suddenly like you didn't have a web app anymore,

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:34.220
 like you remember not working on an application

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:35.420
 where you had to sort of, you know,

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:38.300
 do remote procedure calls or, you know,

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:40.500
 think about error handling on the backend

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:43.540
 or sort of, you know, sanitizing your data

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:46.940
 or whatever is involved in sending data to the backend

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:49.820
 and then, you know, receiving it.

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:53.420
 But literally what you had once Zoom was implemented

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:56.620
 was sort of a local structure of, you know, of data

00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:59.140
 representing the state of your application.

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:01.900
 And that was all that you had to work with.

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:03.460
 You never had to go to the backend.

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:04.980
 You never had to literally do anything

00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:07.660
 'cause, you know, the sync engine would handle

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:08.820
 all of it for you.

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:10.460
 You didn't have to think about error cases

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:11.500
 'cause the sync engine, again,

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:15.620
 would handle most of these error cases for you automatically.

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:17.700
 So you were just like, you had a local set of data,

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:19.260
 you would manipulate that data

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:21.380
 and, you know, eventually you would call save

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:22.580
 on, you know, some of the objects

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:24.740
 that you actually wanted to commit to.

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:26.380
 And that was all you needed to do.

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:28.380
 So when you wanted to build a feature,

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:31.180
 you just essentially, you know, add it to that data,

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:32.860
 showed it in your UI and you were done.

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:35.140
 It makes it so much faster to build, you know,

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:35.980
 build the product.

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:38.300
 And I think, you know, it's one of the biggest reasons

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:40.260
 why we're so quick at, you know, shipping,

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:41.700
 new functionality later.

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:42.540
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:46.380
 I mean, that's been, that's been my experience as well.

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:48.980
 It's a little bit of set up initially

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:50.740
 to get everything set up correctly.

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:52.300
 And it's a little bit of a mental model shift

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:54.500
 'cause it's quite different from how most people

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:55.580
 build things.

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:57.420
 But once that's done and we just,

00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:01.540
 so we hit, we released a V1, a beta of our new product.

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:03.140
 And that was a good amount of effort,

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:04.100
 a good amount of concentrated effort.

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:06.420
 This past week, we've just been adding new features

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:07.260
 on top of it.

00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:08.820
 It's been insanely fast.

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:12.460
 Like, like, I'd allocate like two days to do something.

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:13.660
 I would finish it in two hours.

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:16.060
 You know, it's kind of like, it's not just a slight

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:17.900
 improvement, it's like a multiple improvement.

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:20.580
 It's really, really incredible.

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:21.740
 The other thing that you mentioned is

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:22.700
 the finite set of data.

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:24.460
 I think this is pretty interesting

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:26.500
 because I think when people hear that,

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:28.540
 they might think, oh, it's a very narrow use case.

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:30.140
 That fits like, 'cause obviously data is always growing.

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:31.540
 It's always changing.

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:34.140
 But you can be pretty creative about what that means, right?

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:37.740
 So with linear, obviously your issues can grow forever

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:40.140
 for all of time, right?

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:41.980
 So you would think that's not finite.

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.620
 But practically, there is like a working set

00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:45.740
 of issues that you care about.

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:48.020
 You know, there's maybe, maybe you expire out issues.

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:49.300
 I don't know what exactly what linear logic is,

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:51.100
 but maybe you expire out issues

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:53.100
 that have been closed that are more than 30 days old.

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:56.900
 And it's unlikely that that set of data

00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:58.860
 is gonna grow infinitely 'cause you're the rate

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:01.620
 that your team creates issues probably is staying the same.

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:05.300
 So I think a lot of applications actually can work

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:07.820
 under this model because you have natural ways

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:11.460
 of partitioning things, like B2B applications like linear.

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:13.900
 You're not thinking all the customer's issues,

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:16.780
 just your own workspace's issues, right?

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:19.700
 And even like B2C applications, like you said, Uber,

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:20.740
 it's not a social app.

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:22.980
 You're not like downloading everyone else's information.

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:24.820
 It's just your own information and your own trips.

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:29.060
 So that does cover like a good portion of use cases, right?

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:30.980
 - It does, and to give you an example

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:33.540
 of sort of the finite data set of Uber.

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:37.500
 Uber, you know, when I joined, they were using what, you know,

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:39.620
 they called, hopefully it's no longer there.

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:42.860
 They called Ping, which was a Ping to the server

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:45.780
 every three seconds that would fetch all the data

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:47.660
 that the user could ever see.

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:51.140
 I included sort of user accounts and trips and past trips

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:53.740
 and future trips and everything.

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:54.980
 And they would sort of ping the server

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:56.140
 every three seconds with that.

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:58.340
 So they sort of almost were on Cinq,

00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:00.300
 just a very sort of bad Cinq.

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:02.260
 'Cause they would, you know, every single time

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:04.980
 sort of get the entire set set of data.

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:07.940
 So yes, most applications, if you're not talking

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:11.220
 about sort of the social graph of sorts,

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:13.860
 do have a finite set of data.

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:16.100
 And even, you know, even in linear,

00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:19.260
 where you're constrained to one workspace at a time,

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:21.380
 we still, within that workspace,

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:22.940
 are able to partition the data.

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:25.540
 You know, they were sort of kind of optimize

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:28.100
 what we load in the beginning and what not to load.

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:32.700
 So we do load everything that sort of has some sort of,

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:34.980
 you know, finite, you know, finite set,

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:37.140
 which is sort of your teams and your users

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:38.460
 and your not the issues.

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:41.260
 Like teams, users, organizations and labels

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:45.740
 and things that sort of, we have under 1000s off issues.

00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:48.180
 You know, we do see customers who have, you know,

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:49.780
 hundreds of thousands of issues.

00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:51.700
 So we don't want to load them all.

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:53.180
 'Cause they're usually associated with a team.

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:55.380
 And, you know, if you have a large organization,

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:59.060
 like you will only be part of a few teams here and there.

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:02.100
 So it's not necessary for you to load up, you know,

00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:04.180
 the issues of all teams in order to, you know,

00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:05.140
 have them locally available.

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:06.220
 You can do that dynamically.

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:09.780
 Like when you, you know, when you look into a team

00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:11.580
 that you haven't looked in a while,

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:14.460
 we can load up the issues of that team at that point.

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:16.300
 Even if you go into sort of the issue itself,

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:18.140
 like we've got comments and issue history,

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:21.580
 which are only available and visible in just a few screens.

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:24.660
 So we're selective of, you know, not loading them at startup,

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:27.580
 just to get you to the first UI as quickly as possible,

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:30.180
 even if you're starting with a cold client.

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:32.780
 But when you then sort of navigate to a team,

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:34.940
 in the background, we start streaming in the data

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:37.300
 that, you know, we anticipate that you'll need

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:38.540
 in the future.

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:40.780
 And first case, like if you look at an issue

00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:42.860
 and you haven't loaded any of the data,

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:44.820
 you'll see a blank screen, a quick loading screen

00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:46.460
 for like half a second and then, you know,

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:49.260
 data streams in 'cause, you know, it gets prioritized

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:51.860
 of what we load at that point in time.

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:53.700
 From a sort of engineering perspective,

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:56.180
 the easiest way to build an application would be

00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:59.340
 that everything is local and actually in memory,

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:00.940
 'cause then you don't need to sort of work

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:02.620
 with asynchronous data.

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:04.220
 You would have just a struct of, you know,

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:07.020
 in memory data and you could just render your UI

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:08.380
 as you please.

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:11.060
 The moment when, you know, things can pop in, you know,

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:14.580
 you need to work around it a bit and sort of, you know,

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:17.700
 account for that, you know, you might not be able to show

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:20.780
 some UI elements or some UI elements might pop in, you know,

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:22.540
 few milliseconds later after your initial render

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:25.500
 because you need to hydrate them either from this score,

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:27.180
 you know, go to the network.

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:29.940
 So it becomes a bit more problematic, but, you know,

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:32.660
 it's still, you know, quite quite easy to implement.

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:33.500
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:35.660
 And it's kind of like, like 80% of your stuff,

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:37.460
 it's on that first case and it's kind of like,

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:39.420
 it's kind of diminishes, like there are some cases

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:41.900
 where you need to handle it specifically.

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:44.980
 So me and my wife also, we work on another app together

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:49.980
 and it's very similar, like 95% of the day-to-day usage

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:52.820
 of the app fits into that very simple.

00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:55.740
 Everything is local, operation running locally model.

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:58.300
 But there are, you know, some situations where they're

00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:01.300
 looking at reporting and they're looking at larger,

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:03.220
 they're asking larger questions of the app.

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:06.380
 And for there, we'll fall back to something more traditional.

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:07.340
 But to me, it's like progressive.

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:08.940
 Like you try to do it locally, if not,

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:11.940
 then you kind of progress to the more network-powered things.

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:15.460
 And you'll find that, yeah, most, most data operations

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:17.220
 can exist locally.

00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:18.620
 So one of the questions that I get a lot,

00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:20.180
 and I actually see in the chat right now is,

00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:22.820
 I think when people hear this model, they think like,

00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:26.820
 words like CRDTs or like kind of eventual consistency.

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:27.900
 But it's quite different, right?

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:31.500
 Sinking is very different than like collaborative,

00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:34.500
 conflict resolution type stuff.

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:36.900
 Do you have any thoughts on the differences there?

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:38.100
 - Yeah, sure.

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:41.140
 Like, so we beat them, use CRDTs for the longest time.

00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:43.340
 We're actually implementing final CRDTs

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:46.100
 for our description editor.

00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:47.940
 Hopefully, we'll have it live at some point.

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:50.500
 Because that was literally the only point in the application

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:53.620
 where it didn't feel like being real-time yet.

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:55.580
 But if you look at an issue, for example,

00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:57.860
 like an issue can have a priority.

00:34:57.860 --> 00:34:59.740
 And if you modify that priority, like, there's

00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:02.020
 nothing related to CRDTs that you can do there.

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:06.540
 Like somebody sets that priority, and the last one will win.

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:08.740
 If I set it to high and you set it to medium,

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:11.860
 but should it actually be, like, CRDTs can't resolve that for you

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:14.700
 and sort of set it to medium plus or something.

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:17.980
 So for the most of the properties on our model objects,

00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:22.660
 like we just utilized the last one wins schema,

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:24.340
 we don't even show you any conflicts.

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:26.380
 Like if people flip it at the same time,

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:28.820
 like we don't show you that, you know, it was just changed

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:32.060
 as you made the change because it's really not that necessary.

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:35.140
 And people very infrequently modify the same data,

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:37.420
 even if you're at a large company.

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:40.500
 But yeah, like the editor was the last piece

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:42.580
 that we always felt wasn't great.

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:45.380
 And we've postponed it for a pretty long time.

00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:50.140
 Like it's been on our backlog for, I think, three years.

00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:52.660
 And we always wanted to make a sort of fully collaborative

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:55.860
 editor that utilized CRDTs so that multiple people can

00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:59.300
 edit it at the same time, see all the changes coming in,

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:03.580
 and sort of have conflict resolution in the editor itself.

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:06.900
 But we just realized that it's not that many people

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:10.380
 that edit issue descriptions at the same time,

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:12.340
 so it wasn't really a priority for us.

00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:15.260
 Now that we want to use the editor for a few other things,

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:17.540
 where we do anticipate that there will be multiple people

00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:20.860
 joining into a session, you know, we want to make

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:23.660
 that use case work well as well.

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:25.660
 And just use CRDTs for text editing.

00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:27.580
 - Yeah, it's funny, right before you joined,

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:31.540
 someone asked the question, hey, can you ask them why,

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:33.980
 I think that there's a linear docs feature,

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:36.820
 why the editing there goes off.

00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:39.180
 And I actually guessed that it was exactly this.

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:42.380
 So I'm gonna take the mantle that I know more about linear

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:45.100
 than anyone that hasn't worked there.

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:46.940
 So I've just looked at it so much.

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:48.620
 But yeah, so that kind of confirms that question,

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:51.820
 which is, again, it goes to that like 80/20 thing,

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:53.900
 like 80% of your application is not collaborative

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:57.620
 real-time editing, which is very simple data synchronizing.

00:36:57.620 --> 00:36:59.260
 And there's a small portion that does need that,

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:02.660
 and you can kind of progressively look into that.

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:05.780
 I think the thing that people kind of conflate this stuff is,

00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:07.420
 when they hear this, they think about,

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:09.280
 oh, is it like peer-to-peer?

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:10.540
 It's like that type of situation,

00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:13.740
 but it's not peer-to-peer, it looks somewhat similar

00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:15.380
 'cause you're synchronizing states.

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:18.140
 The difference between peer-to-peer and this is there's

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:20.100
 a very important peer, which is the server,

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:23.580
 which has ultimate authority on when something happened,

00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:26.180
 what order happened in, what's the last thing that happened.

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:28.180
 So when you have that in play,

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:29.540
 which is how most web apps work,

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:31.900
 most web apps aren't really peer-to-peer applications,

00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:34.820
 you don't need the complexity of CRDTs

00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:35.860
 to the majority of things.

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:39.060
 So you have this authoritative server

00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:41.740
 that can determine authoritative states,

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:43.460
 and it massively simplifies everything.

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:46.900
 So this isn't as complicated as people may have seen

00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:49.780
 with kind of peer-to-peer technologies.

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:51.460
 - For sure, yeah.

00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:55.980
 And like, you could make linear peer-to-peer network as well,

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:58.580
 but I don't know what the benefits would be.

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:02.140
 Like, even with our current model, like when we run,

00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:04.220
 which was like the third thing that we got out of sync,

00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:06.260
 interestingly enough is, you know,

00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:09.300
 hugely smaller resource requirements on the backend.

00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:10.580
 Like, we're running this, you know,

00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:13.860
 with so few servers that, you know, you could hardly imagine.

00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:15.540
 'Cause most of the operations again,

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:17.300
 happen on the client, like there's no queries

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:18.700
 that the client sends to the backend.

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:21.060
 So it's only mutations essentially being, you know,

00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:26.060
 saved or, you know, being operated on, on the backend.

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:29.380
 And you do still want to sort of, you know,

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:31.300
 do all kinds of validation and, you know,

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:33.420
 have an API where people can sort of submit

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:35.220
 the same mutations as well.

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:38.780
 So, you know, we need a backend for those operations.

00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:40.740
 - Yeah, there's another thing that we've noticed as well.

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:43.780
 I think before performance work looked like

00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:45.420
 trying to make my backend faster,

00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:46.620
 trying to make my database faster,

00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:48.660
 trying to like make all those response times faster.

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:51.140
 I haven't thought about that in so long.

00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:52.940
 I have no idea how slow my backend is.

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:54.580
 It could be super slow for all I know,

00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:58.100
 but you just cannot tell when you're using the application.

00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:00.460
 So yeah, I always find it's interesting

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:02.220
 where I think when people think about performance,

00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:05.940
 they think about optimizing like very specific things.

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:07.540
 Like I'm going to optimize this code block

00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:09.420
 or I'm going to make my database faster,

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:11.140
 like these individual components.

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:14.260
 But performance oftentimes just comes from your architecture.

00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:16.100
 Like what is architecture you chose

00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:17.660
 that can make certain things really easy,

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:19.420
 other things really hard.

00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:21.540
 And yeah, it's quite fascinating

00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:26.420
 because I think right now if you look at,

00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:29.820
 I mean, it's hard to say what is the correct source for this,

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:33.860
 but if I look at the conversations that a lot of

00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:35.980
 web developers are having,

00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:39.100
 it's all about optimizing server rendering speed

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:42.940
 and building these server rendered applications

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:44.900
 or like, you know, building new frameworks

00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:46.940
 that are more performance.

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:49.220
 And I love to point to them that, you know, linear,

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:53.380
 which is feels as a user feels way more performance

00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:55.260
 than majority of applications.

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:56.540
 And correct me if I'm wrong on this,

00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:57.940
 it's just a React application

00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:00.180
 and it's just a traditional SPA, right?

00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:01.940
 Nothing fancy going on there.

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:03.860
 - No, it's straight up.

00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:06.260
 Well, sure, like we have, you know,

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:08.540
 optimized it and made sure that performance, you know,

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:10.860
 on the client is good.

00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:12.340
 So a lot of work goes in there.

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:13.980
 - Yeah, but it's like just the same technology

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:15.900
 that's been around for a while,

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:17.580
 just, you know, implemented in an architecture

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:19.980
 that allows it to be really fast.

00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:21.460
 And yeah, that's why I've been excited to talk to you

00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:23.660
 and kind of make this more,

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:25.980
 make me more aware of this because,

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:29.540
 yeah, there's just a gap.

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:32.700
 Have you seen more companies now that you guys are out there

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:35.060
 doing it with this approach?

00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:37.660
 Have you seen more companies take this approach?

00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:39.020
 I'm telling you like, we're doing it,

00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:40.820
 but have you seen it grow a little bit more?

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:42.100
 - I mean, not really.

00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:44.900
 I would assume that, you know, startups that start,

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:46.820
 you know, are founded nowadays

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:48.380
 would have a look at synchronization.

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:50.900
 Like if it's a good use case for them,

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:53.420
 I haven't personally sort of, you know, used,

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:57.220
 I don't wanna say any apps that do synchronization,

00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:59.860
 but you know, most of the applications that I use

00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:02.740
 probably don't, I wouldn't know if they do.

00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:05.340
 Yeah, yeah, I don't know.

00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:07.500
 Hopefully it will just take time, you know,

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:10.460
 for people to sort of start toying around with this.

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:12.100
 The problem is that, you know,

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:14.060
 when you're building something

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:16.540
 where you really don't have product market fit,

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:19.540
 it's insane to start with this synchronization engine.

00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:22.220
 Like it's kind of wasteful and useless,

00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:24.980
 like to throw it all away, all that hard engineering.

00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:26.660
 It's not, it is hard engineering.

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:28.620
 Like it takes you time to build a good, you know,

00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:30.260
 synchronization engine.

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:33.460
 And the off the shelf solutions, you know,

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:35.100
 might work for smaller companies,

00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:37.220
 but at some point, like you'll have to build yourself,

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:40.500
 you know, to optimize the use case for your users.

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:41.580
 So it's a big investment.

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:43.060
 And if you don't know, like, you know,

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:45.620
 what your product is, it's going to be,

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:47.900
 or whether it's gonna take off then, you know,

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:49.900
 you probably don't want to make that investment.

00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:51.860
 And once your product takes off, like, you know,

00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:53.660
 it might be too late to make that investment already.

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:54.500
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:57.220
 That's why the business part ties in really well, right?

00:41:57.220 --> 00:42:00.340
 You guys were entering a very established clear market.

00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:01.500
 You weren't trying to create a new market,

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:03.260
 various established market.

00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:05.260
 And very clear that your entire edge

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:06.700
 that you're going to have is the execution.

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:09.900
 So it made sense to kind of invest upfront.

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:12.220
 So speaking of off the shelf solutions,

00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:13.460
 have you heard of Replicash?

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:14.300
 - I have, yeah.

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:16.500
 - So we, that's what we use for our products.

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:18.860
 And it was interesting because, you know,

00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:20.180
 I've been researching linear for a while.

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:21.460
 I was like, okay, how am I going to do this?

00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:22.420
 And I was looking around,

00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:23.620
 and eventually stumbled upon it.

00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:27.340
 And on their homepage, their demo is a linear cloud.

00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:29.420
 And I was like, this is the best way to advertise,

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:31.380
 'cause this is what everyone is looking for,

00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:32.220
 or not everyone.

00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:33.820
 Again, really small set of people

00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:35.580
 that I think have discovered this are interested in this,

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:38.220
 but I'm fairly excited about that.

00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:41.020
 And I think this is what I love to see in technology

00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:44.420
 where it wasn't solution-led.

00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:45.980
 I found a product that I loved.

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:49.060
 And I loved it so much that I just had to know

00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:50.340
 how it was built.

00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:51.820
 And I imagine the Replicash founders

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:54.380
 also probably saw linear at some point.

00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:58.260
 You kind of see the approach proved out in a product

00:42:58.260 --> 00:42:59.780
 for the end user.

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:01.780
 Then you kind of build a solution afterward

00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:05.060
 that can make it more accessible to more people.

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:08.940
 I think a lot of times we see solutions kind of put forth

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:10.100
 and you're like, that looks cool,

00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:13.020
 but I haven't actually, like what,

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:14.220
 like show me a product built with it,

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:17.420
 show me why it actually feels good to user,

00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:20.780
 what's a cool thing you can build with it.

00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:22.540
 And this is a great example of a going in the direction

00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:25.300
 that I think actually makes sense, right?

00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:28.220
 So I'm pretty optimistic for Replicash.

00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:30.380
 Again, like you said, I can already see in places

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:32.700
 where we're gonna outgrow it in some ways,

00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:35.420
 but just to make that initial,

00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:36.820
 you don't have to build your own sync engine.

00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:39.220
 It's still, and I wanna make this clear

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:41.300
 for everyone listening, it's hard.

00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:44.940
 Even when you're using an off-the-shelf solution,

00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:47.380
 it's just very different from what you're used to.

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:48.980
 And it does take effort,

00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:52.380
 but if your goal is to out execute everyone else,

00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:54.940
 it's just gonna take effort, right?

00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:57.100
 But it's definitely worth it, in my opinion.

00:43:57.100 --> 00:44:01.860
 - Cool, yeah, you know, people should definitely look into it.

00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:04.060
 And like, obviously there's other solutions as well,

00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:07.140
 like Firebase being the oldest one of them all.

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:08.340
 Like that was actually, you know,

00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:10.660
 one of the initial sort of proofs of concept

00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:13.020
 that we did, like my first implementation

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:14.500
 was on coach base.

00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:18.140
 - I'm sorry, coach base, coach base, coach base.

00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:19.740
 - And then, then all that.

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:22.140
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah, coach DB.

00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:24.980
 And then Firebase as well.

00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:26.500
 And we sort of quickly realized that, you know,

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:27.540
 they wouldn't work for us.

00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:29.620
 Like, I think coach DB, you know,

00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:32.620
 just didn't have any access control.

00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:34.900
 Back then, I don't know if they do now.

00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:38.140
 And then Firebase, like, we did a small quick calculation

00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:40.340
 on the costs and, you know, our use case

00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:42.860
 would have been costs us, you know, millions of dollars

00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:44.660
 to access the load of all of that data.

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:47.060
 So it wouldn't have worked for us.

00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:48.260
 But it might work for you.

00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:49.980
 Like if you're working, you know, on something small

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:53.460
 and you want to just, you know, add synchronization as,

00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:56.860
 and add on to a portion of your application, like, you know,

00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:59.580
 yes, go ahead with, you know, existing solutions

00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:01.020
 and try to, you know, start there

00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:03.940
 and see how we can benefit from losing.

00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:06.260
 - Okay, so people did ask, is it long pulling?

00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:08.060
 Like, what's the actual tech stack

00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:09.380
 that you guys use for synchronization?

00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:10.780
 So I think you've given a few talks

00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:11.820
 and it's probably what documented,

00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:14.140
 but if you can kind of just list it out here.

00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:16.380
 - Yeah, yeah, there's, I do have a few talks

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:20.460
 on how, you know, our sync engine works.

00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:23.340
 But essentially what we have is a WebSocket connection

00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:24.580
 for all this synchronization stuff.

00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:27.940
 And then mutations still have been on a GraphQL connection

00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:30.220
 or a GraphQL request essentially that we make.

00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:31.620
 'Cause we want to have the same backend

00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:33.740
 for the public API and then our clients.

00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:35.780
 We didn't want to duplicate it.

00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:37.540
 So if you make a change on the client,

00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:38.820
 client will create a transaction,

00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:41.540
 send that over, you know, over GraphQL

00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:44.060
 to the backend and the backend will create a sort

00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:47.380
 of log of changes that happen to your workspace

00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:48.700
 and then send those changes back

00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:51.220
 to the user over the WebSocket connection.

00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:53.540
 So you'll be receiving all the changes that you've made

00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:55.940
 and all the changes that everybody else has made

00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:57.060
 through WebSockets.

00:45:57.060 --> 00:45:57.980
 - Yeah, and that's what's interesting

00:45:57.980 --> 00:46:00.220
 'cause it's, you guys do use GraphQL under the hood.

00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:01.980
 So it's a marriage of the synchronization

00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:03.980
 but still relying on like the type safety

00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:07.220
 and all other benefits you get from GraphQL.

00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:08.940
 Yeah, 'cause like you said, I think most companies

00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:10.580
 will need a lot of companies,

00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:12.940
 especially if you're building for other companies,

00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:14.340
 you're gonna need an API,

00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:16.020
 just having something that makes sense internally

00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:18.300
 and externally does make a lot of sense.

00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:19.140
 Okay, cool.

00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:21.540
 So I think that's really everything I had.

00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:22.780
 Thank you so much for joining.

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:24.140
 This was really awesome.

00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:26.300
 Like I said, I just want more people to know

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:27.820
 about how this stuff works under the hood

00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:29.460
 and it kind of be inspired to do the same.

00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:30.540
 Again, thank you for joining,

00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:32.380
 but also thank you for building linear.

00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:33.740
 Like I said, it's hugely influential

00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:35.780
 on everything that I do today,

00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:39.300
 which sounds like is what you guys hope that out to do.

00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:41.180
 So hopefully it's a nice data point.

00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:44.220
 Yeah, that's so great to hear.

00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:45.220
 Yeah, so appreciate it.

00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:46.740
 Thanks so much for having me.

00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:49.320
 (upbeat music)
