WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520
 - Do multiple people live in this building?

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.200
 I thought we were the only apartment.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.880
 - No, no, there's a bunch of apartments in this building.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.720
 - Oh, there is?

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:06.760
 We're just number one?

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:07.600
 - Yeah.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.440
 - That's kinda cool.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.280
 (laughing)

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.100
 - We got number one, do we have to pay extra that?

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.420
 'Cause we're not allowed.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.000
 (upbeat music)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:38.240
 - This is our third time doing this thing together.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.800
 Like meeting up and streaming.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.640
 - What do you mean?

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.480
 Terminal?

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.320
 - Yeah.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.560
 - Third time terminal is the other thing?

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.600
 - Yeah, 'cause we do it in Miami and Dallas

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.720
 and now we're in New York.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.680
 And our setup has gotten better each time.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.720
 - And easier.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.560
 - And easier.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.000
 Like I think we like rebalanced some of some things

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.760
 and like we got this all set up pretty quickly

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.920
 and it's working.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.760
 - Yeah.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.080
 - My bag weighed like 30 pounds less.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.920
 - I think more than 30 pounds, right?

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.760
 - No problem.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.840
 - You had like, you had that whole giant separate bag.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.520
 - Oh, well the first time, so Miami.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.080
 Yeah, I brought way too much stuff.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.920
 It's gotten less that bad.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.080
 - Yeah, you kept trimming it and that.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.480
 - Next time I'm not even being close,

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.560
 I'm just gonna be like,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.720
 showing up no bags.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.560
 What's up, guys?

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.480
 (laughing)

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.880
 - Yeah, no, I had a bag packed

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.120
 that was my full duffle, full of equipment.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.520
 And then you said that to X and said we could use an iPhone

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.680
 and I got to remove all of it

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.040
 and just put my clothes in the duffel.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.840
 - I know, it's really amazing the times we live in.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.720
 Yeah, and look, I brought this little thing just in case.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.680
 (laughing)

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.000
 - So podcast, this is the podcast.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.240
 We're doing a terminal thing.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.080
 - Yes.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.920
 - Did we talk about this thing?

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.920
 Did we talk about this on the podcast ever

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.880
 that we were doing this thing in New York?

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.200
 - We must have, we must have brought it up.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.280
 - I feel like it had to have come up,

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.400
 but like I feel like in the past, like the Dallas thing,

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.880
 we talked about it every episode of like three episodes.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.560
 It was like, we're gonna go to Dallas soon.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.400
 - Yeah.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.320
 - And then it was like, we're going to Dallas tomorrow.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.160
 - Yeah, you know what it was,

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.640
 I think it's because that was,

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.680
 we said we were playing basketball publicly for a while

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.120
 and this we haven't even said it.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.120
 And I guess we can say it now

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.720
 because the podcast won't come out today.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.560
 - It's something I don't mind.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.200
 - Okay, let's actually just talk about what we're doing.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.240
 So we're doing another terminal event.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.800
 This time it is an event in New York.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.760
 We're here.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.560
 We rented out a theater.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.280
 300 people are coming to watch us

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.120
 and we're doing a live family.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.200
 (laughing)

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.440
 - Exactly.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.280
 - Magic trade.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.120
 - There might be a magic.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.840
 - React 16 updates.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.680
 - No.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.000
 - Rec.js 15.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.120
 - Sick, whatever it is.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.200
 - Oh, yeah.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.840
 - How to build the Rec.js tutorial.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.680
 Now, we are doing a family feud game show.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.120
 We're producing a family feud game show.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.000
 It's going to have a bunch of people you recognize

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.160
 from online, from open source,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.200
 from a bunch of things like that.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.640
 - Can you name some people?

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.480
 - Yeah, we have.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.320
 - For my sake.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.120
 - I mean, I don't remember.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.120
 - Okay, we've got Tanner Lindsley.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.960
 - Oh, nice.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.280
 - Up 10 step.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.760
 He's coming.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.800
 We've got Kenzie Dodds.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.960
 - Oh, Kenzie?

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:05.800
 - Yeah.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.640
 - I have no idea.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.800
 - Wow, okay, let's actually just go through this.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.800
 - Let's just go to the list.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.440
 'Cause I don't know if we're gonna receive.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.480
 This is awesome.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.200
 Now, were these people coming for the conference?

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.200
 - They're all flying in just for this one.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.040
 (laughing)

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.120
 Just for us, we're all flying in.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.640
 - Yeah, there's a tech conference

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.880
 that is happening in New York.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.960
 Or is it is a tech conference?

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.800
 - Yeah.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.620
 - Is it what day is that?

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.760
 - It's on Monday and Wednesday.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.120
 Like it's, they're skipping a day in the middle.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.960
 - Okay.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:33.800
 - Okay, no, it's complicated.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.400
 There's a conference called JSN on Monday.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.200
 Then there's a conference called React Summit on Tuesday.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.560
 And then there's a third day.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.880
 - They're not related, they're not related to it.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.640
 - They're not, but then on the kind of coordinating,

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.480
 I can't really tell.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.960
 On the third day, there is another JSN day.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.080
 I don't know, it's very confusing.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.040
 The schedule's really confusing.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.560
 We're not actually going any of it.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.400
 - Remember how confusing the React Miami

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.120
 and that other thing going on was?

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.960
 What was that?

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:57.800
 - I think about that all the time.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.000
 - I get emails still.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.840
 - Really?

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.680
 - What was the name of it?

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.680
 - I can't remember.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.520
 - Immered.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.360
 - Immered Americans.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.200
 - Yeah, I just emerged American emails

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.040
 and I don't know why.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.480
 I guess 'cause I went to React Miami.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.600
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.320
 So anyway, people are in town for that.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.640
 So we, you know, we had this event

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.440
 and we invited a bunch of them and they're coming.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.200
 And I found the list right here.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.040
 - Okay.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.760
 - So Tanner, Ken Wheeler.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.600
 - Ken Wheeler.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.400
 - And I have a work conflict, so I'm not 100% sure.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.200
 Wes Boughs is coming.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.280
 Scott Telensky's coming.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.600
 We got Ben from Krazam,

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.800
 who is famous for his microservices video.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.920
 Another guy he works with named Shiba.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.440
 Carson Gross, who is a HMX.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.760
 - Ah, he's coming.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:42.600
 - Yep.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.440
 - Really?

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.640
 - Ken C. Dodds, who I mentioned.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.040
 Chan is coming.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.960
 - Chantastic?

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:47.800
 - Yeah.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.720
 - Oh, I kill A to C. Chan.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.560
 - Yeah.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.560
 - I've seen lessons.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.000
 - And he's coming, psychotic.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.320
 Everyone's really excited for Annie

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.080
 'cause no one has met her in real life

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.440
 and we're all still not sure if she's a real person.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.800
 - Yeah, has she come to anything?

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.480
 She's not like part of the tech conference scene.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.560
 She's not a developer evangelist.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.600
 So why would she go to tech conferences?

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.440
 (laughing)

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.720
 - No, then why do any of us go?

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.120
 - Yeah.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.120
 - Madison's coming.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.960
 - It's like her tweet.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.040
 - Yeah, Michelle's coming.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.040
 - The restaurant is coming.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.480
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.560
 And then we have JJ, who is from Versailles.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.480
 He works in next year.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.000
 Jimmy Lai, who is the engineering manager for next year's.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.880
 And we have low level.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.720
 - He's coming.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.080
 - I knew low level was coming.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.920
 - Oh, really?

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.240
 - I just happened to be DMing him about unrelated things.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.600
 And he was like, "Between me and you."

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.600
 So it may have been secret.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.880
 Was it a secret he's coming?

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.200
 - Not to me, obviously.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.040
 - Oh, well, yeah.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.520
 (laughing)

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.080
 - We've been at levels of information.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.080
 - Yeah, they're surprised for me for this event.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.920
 That's crazy.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.760
 And I planned the event as well.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.520
 - But was it like kind of low key that he was--

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.160
 - I don't think we've announced anyone really.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.000
 - Oh, right.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.840
 - Cheers, Kazam, yeah.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.160
 - Oh, Kazam, 'cause we tweeted that.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.000
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.840
 - Good job.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.360
 - And then the last person was Bash.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.080
 - Bash, yeah, I knew Bash was kinda commander.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.240
 - Oh, she can be a contestant?

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.080
 - Yep.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.400
 - You were just naming contestants?

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.440
 - Yeah, just contestants.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.120
 Oh, and there's like, yeah, 300 people on top of this.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.120
 Oh, and here's the best part.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.800
 After the event, I really hope it goes well,

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.720
 'cause it's gonna be a bummer

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.760
 if we're like, ah, it didn't go really well.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.680
 Whether it goes well or not, we have an after party

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.920
 that we have invited around 70 to 80 people to.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.600
 - Wait, who are those people?

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.560
 - It's everyone we listed,

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.240
 and then there's other people that we know in New York.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.560
 - Oh, okay.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.960
 - And there's people that are coming to the event

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.000
 that aren't participants, so there's like 70 people or so,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.840
 we're going to this place.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:35.680
 Actually, we're on the corner.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.520
 It's a good ball.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:37.880
 - So it's 70 people that we'll probably know,

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.240
 or it's a lot of people I want to.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.120
 - I think you'll know everyone.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.120
 I don't think there's any one.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.000
 - 70 people.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.520
 - Let me, well, Liz made a list.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.640
 Let me call out who.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.360
 - By the way, shout out Liz.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.480
 - MVP of this whole thing.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.320
 - I know.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.360
 - She's been on top of it.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.760
 The messages she'll send, they're so organized,

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.800
 and everybody's action items, and adding us all.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.640
 It's amazing.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.120
 I feel like such a jerk for being so checked out.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.080
 - No, I mean, this is like,

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.080
 she genuinely enjoys planning events,

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.360
 and she's particularly good at it,

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.620
 so this has been a good situation.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.480
 - Your shirt and my pants are the same color.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.920
 - My pants and your pants are the same color.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.200
 I'm wearing all green.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.200
 - What?

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.640
 - Your shirt and pants match?

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:18.480
 - I always wear this.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.320
 - Is that okay?

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.200
 - Somehow, I always end up wearing this exact outfit

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.080
 when I fly, 'cause it's like very comfy.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:23.920
 - We talked about this.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:24.760
 I don't wear the same outfit.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.240
 - And I also have, I don't wear this.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.640
 I have a jacket that's also this color,

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.200
 so I could have been like, okay.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.320
 - Is that kind of like against,

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.680
 I'm not like the most fashion forward person?

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.400
 - It's one of those things where like,

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.600
 yes, it's wrong, but if you do the tension

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.480
 and it becomes right again.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.400
 - If you know the rules, you can break them.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.760
 (laughing)

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.520
 - Okay, it's all the people I listed plus us,

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.800
 which is already like 20.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.160
 - There's 50 more to go next.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.000
 - Oh, Turk is coming.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:52.840
 - It's coming.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.720
 - Oh, I knew Turk was it, 'cause he lives in New York.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.200
 - Yeah, yeah, and we invited him to the party.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.200
 We invited Rich Harris and I was going,

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.760
 AJ is gonna be here, he's a party.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.680
 Joe Tenenbaum, he's a guy.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.520
 - Yeah.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:05.600
 - Yeah, from Larry Bell that works.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.480
 - Me and Joe go way back.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.320
 - Is that true?

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.140
 - No.

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.400
 - Oh, I totally forgot, I totally forgot this.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.400
 Okay.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.040
 So, I'm gonna call my kid, 'cause he's in school.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.200
 Some kid, he's like in college,

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.480
 in a Waterloo in Toronto,

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.360
 made a bunch of arcade games in the terminal.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.200
 - Yeah.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.760
 - Snake, a bunch of stuff.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.520
 And I was like, this is amazing,

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.480
 we should post this at arcade.thermal.shop.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.320
 And--

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.160
 - Are we gonna do that?

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.440
 - Yeah, and so I messaged him like,

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.760
 hey, can we just, like, can we just have your project?

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:36.600
 - Yeah.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.880
 - And in exchange, I was like, we'll fly you to New York

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.320
 and you'll come hang out with us.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.160
 - Fair trade.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:41.920
 - Yeah, on Monday.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.800
 And then, so he's gonna come, help us out,

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.080
 hang out, does come without the party,

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.680
 so hopefully we'll have a good time.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.520
 - And then we're gonna put it all on target.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.880
 - Yeah, and then we'll have like a give,

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.760
 we'll have like a give away for the highest score,

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:53.600
 whatever it's all about.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.760
 - Yeah.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.560
 - Jay, from ST, he's coming,

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.880
 and his girlfriend's also coming.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:00.720
 - Nice.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.880
 - We invited Maher and Youssef,

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:05.680
 their, like, our coffee partners.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.120
 Youssef's brother.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.800
 Chris, from Twitch, Chris Griffin.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.640
 - Oh, does he live in New York?

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:13.840
 - I don't think so, but I saw him.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.760
 - I saw him on her list, so I added the thing.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:17.600
 - Nice.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.880
 - And there's a few others, but anyway,

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.240
 point is, it's a lot of people that we know.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.640
 - Like, I'm glad low level and Chris will be here,

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.720
 people I didn't get to see,

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.880
 'cause I didn't go to TwitchCon.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.160
 Like, yeah, yeah, there's some people I didn't met here.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.240
 - The bummer did not go, and then...

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.080
 - Yeah.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.600
 - You get to see those people, that's great.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.240
 - So, that's what we're doing on Monday.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.840
 But the next two days, we're actually building

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.440
 a lot of the stuff we need for Monday,

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.680
 so we better hopefully...

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.040
 - Yeah, maybe we'll double dip here.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.520
 Let's, we get to say what's on this podcast,

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.140
 and I say, we're gonna talk through

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.640
 what we need to build tomorrow.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:46.480
 - Yeah.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.080
 - And then Saturday, or Saturday and Sunday.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.080
 - There's not that much, but...

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.640
 - 'Cause they teach in primary building stuff.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:53.480
 - Yep.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.800
 - And we need to build stuff.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.320
 Can we just hit real high level of what we need to build?

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.160
 - Yeah.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.000
 - So this is coming out on Monday,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:09:59.840
 but it's coming out on Monday.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.400
 This episode come out before the thing.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.240
 - Probably.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.480
 - But they'll know what it is, 'cause we'll see.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.800
 - Yeah, we'll be, it's not supposed to be secret at that point.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.840
 Yeah, so there's, we basically have a few components.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.080
 I'm about to talk about the big problem that we haven't solved.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.760
 So we have the scoreboard, which needs to go on the screen.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.200
 That's gonna be a web app.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.200
 - I said family feud, right?

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.040
 - Yeah, it's family feud.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:19.960
 Yeah, I said that.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.800
 So I built like the control plane for it,

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.440
 so there's like a web socket server.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.280
 - And you say control plane.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.760
 That sounds so official,

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.440
 and I feel like I should know what that means.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.280
 - What is that mean?

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:32.120
 - I gotta be honest,

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:32.960
 that's the first time I'd use that word.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:33.800
 - Oh really?

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.200
 - Yeah, and I'm using it for family feud evolving.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.600
 - It just sounds like this official technology term

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.800
 like it's in the design patterns book or something.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.640
 - I don't know what it means.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.800
 The design pattern of control planes states that.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.800
 - I don't know what the why the word plane is in there.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:47.960
 It's just a control panel.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:48.800
 - Or like.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:49.640
 - Is it like an API?

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:50.480
 What do you mean?

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.320
 - I guess it's like this.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:56.320
 Okay, point is there is a system that this,

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:00.080
 a back end system or a web socket can still connect to.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.600
 We can send events to the system

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.120
 and there's like a state machine

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.120
 that like tracks the state of the game.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.800
 And it'll sync that state to the scoreboard

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.400
 and we can render stuff off of it.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.280
 So we can send an event like reveal answer

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:16.000
 and then it'll like transmit that event of course

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.800
 so it can like play the ding noise,

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.160
 but then also I'll play the state

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.320
 with the answer that's revealed.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.160
 - Okay.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.040
 - So it's like a nice system to do that kind of thing

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.320
 and then we have to build a UI that wires up.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.400
 - Have you already sourced the ding noise?

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.240
 - Yes.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.840
 - I searched family feud sound effects

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:36.840
 and somebody made a sound board.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.480
 - 'Cause it's like an iconic thing.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.300
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:41.540
 And I've got the actual one.

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:42.380
 - That's amazing.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:44.520
 - And it was, I like wired it up and I kept hitting the button

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.520
 and it was just making me laugh.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:46.380
 It was so funny.

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:50.720
 But we have to build like the actual UI for the scoreboard.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.960
 Then the trick with our family feud is

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.640
 it's all gonna be the survey is gonna happen live

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.120
 with the audience and people watching.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.840
 So prime and team are gonna build a system

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.640
 that pulls the audience, gets thousands of answers,

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.600
 then uses AI to categorize them into like, you know,

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.720
 six or seven for the round.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:08.680
 - What could go wrong?

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:09.520
 - I know.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.800
 (laughing)

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.200
 So, and we're going to do this all this weekend

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.680
 and then it's gonna run live.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:17.000
 - Oh, geez.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.080
 This is like the worst live demo ever.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:19.900
 - Yeah, don't worry.

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:20.800
 I have secret goggles there.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:21.640
 - Okay, yeah.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.760
 (laughing)

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.720
 - But we get to build, they're not building the UI.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:27.840
 - They are building the UI.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.120
 - The scoreboard?

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:29.960
 - No, not the scoreboard.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:31.960
 They're building the UI for the survey answers,

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:32.800
 which is just like--

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.840
 - So the survey answers, that's gonna be participants

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.680
 in the crowd and they're gonna be on their phones

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.800
 on a native app or a web app.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:40.640
 - It's a web app, yeah.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.280
 - And people at home too.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.120
 - Okay.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:43.960
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.000
 - Oh, that's why he said thousands.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.480
 Anyone watching on Twitch can also--

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.320
 - Yeah.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.160
 - Nice.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:53.080
 - Yep, and we'll get, we'll get that.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.240
 And that's what we have to build.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.480
 But you know, here is the--

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.120
 - Sorry, are we having David design that part too,

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.080
 since everyone's gonna be downloading it?

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.520
 - Yeah, I think if we have time, we should do that.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:05.880
 But obviously, there's more boards of priority.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.880
 But here's the thing we haven't figured out.

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:08.920
 The big problem.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.880
 Buzzers.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.240
 - Well, like physical buzzers?

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.320
 That's a physical problem.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.600
 We don't solve physical buzzers.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.360
 - No, listen, so we, I don't think we brought them.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.680
 We actually have buzzers at our house, so we bought,

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.680
 but the issue is they're not,

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.880
 they just like make their own noise.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:29.880
 I want a buzzer that sends over to something,

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.200
 and this exists on Amazon,

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.200
 and maybe we can same day ship it over the next two days.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.840
 But again, in the physical theater,

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.960
 like is it gonna reach the laptop it needs to reach?

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.360
 So we gotta like figure out something there.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:49.360
 - So, okay, my first question goes to,

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.440
 what kind of buzzer do these on the actual game?

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.240
 'Cause now that I know we have the actual sound,

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.120
 is it like the little hand clicky one or is it like a--

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.480
 - No, no, no, it's a thing that you smash.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.720
 - Big button, okay.

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.680
 - And each contestant has your own button, ideally?

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.600
 - No, no, no, no, so the button only,

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.040
 there's like, at the beginning of each round,

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.040
 there's one face off in the center.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.560
 So there's only two buttons.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:08.560
 - Oh, okay.

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.760
 So there's two buttons,

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.920
 and they're in one spot in the center.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.000
 So there's just two buzzers.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.520
 Yeah, this seems like a solvable problem.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.520
 - But like, it needs,

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:20.600
 but it also needs to make a noise for in the venue.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.440
 - That'll happen 'cause it'll go over,

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.440
 the event will go into our event system,

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.040
 come back down to the thing that's the scoreboard,

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.240
 that's just playing the scoreboard,

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.680
 and that web app will play the noise.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.520
 - Oh, that's playing on the projector,

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.080
 like that web app is gonna play a noise in the venue too.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:37.920
 - Yep, exactly.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.080
 - So buzzers will play in the venue.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.520
 - Yep, and that audio will go to everyone's training

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.360
 at home too.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.600
 - Whew, real life is hard.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:45.440
 - I know.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.280
 - Events are hard.

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:50.600
 - So I'm gonna try to see if we can order like a Bluetooth buzzer,

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.360
 or even just like a USB buzzer,

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.240
 and we can like connect it to a laptop

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.200
 and just have a laptop on the podium.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.840
 And that laptop can send the event over.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:04.400
 But yeah, I'm just like, I need like the buzzer we got,

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.080
 we're just like bad and powered buzzers.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:09.840
 - So they make those like internet of things buttons

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:13.160
 that can like hook up to, if this than that.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.000
 - Oh, true.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.400
 - But those would have like the physical hardware

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.720
 to connect to Wi-Fi or whatever.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.440
 You need like a Wi-Fi connected button.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.280
 - That's, yeah, that's so true.

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.000
 We can just, you get a Wi-Fi connected button.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.040
 Okay, that's definitely solved.

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:26.520
 We can go to Best Buy and get some things from there.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.240
 - But then we need to like make it look like a big buzzer.

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.080
 I don't know.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:31.680
 Maybe getting them into stuff I don't wanna think about.

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:34.160
 - Okay, so that's like our big, our big problem.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.240
 - That's a big problem, okay.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.480
 - But that's basically what we're building.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.320
 - And who's hosting?

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.080
 It's prime and teach, they're hosting.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:42.400
 - So we'll have three rounds.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:47.040
 We're gonna have the first round with two teams of guests,

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.120
 second round of two teams of guests.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.800
 Prime and TJ are gonna co-host each round.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.240
 The third round, we're gonna randomly pick from the audience

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.160
 five people.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:59.320
 And if we can do this in a fun way through the little thing,

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.840
 like it's like everyone goes through a screen

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.040
 and then it like lights up saying you've been selected.

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:03.880
 - Like golden tickets?

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.200
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.000
 So that would be fun.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 And it's gonna be the terminal team,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.480
 the five of us against five random audience members.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:12.320
 - Nice.

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.520
 - And whoever gets picked,

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.200
 we'll get and invite to our after party again.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.960
 I don't know if they're gonna be able to go,

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:17.960
 but it's a nice gesture.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:18.800
 - Oh, that's cool.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.120
 The team that plays the random audience members

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.320
 get to come to the after party.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.240
 - Yeah.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.040
 - You guys really thought through all this stuff.

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:25.880
 - I know.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:26.720
 - I'm very impressed.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:27.560
 - We had a lot of time.

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:28.960
 Like we actually, we had like three hands.

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:29.800
 - It's planned for a while.

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:30.640
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.040
 So, oh wait, we forgot.

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.920
 In the middle of the rounds,

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.080
 we're gonna air two commercials.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.560
 - Is that, I didn't notice two.

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:38.400
 I just-

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.240
 - Well, Century paid us.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.960
 Century, so this whole event is sponsored

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.360
 by a few sponsors.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:43.520
 Centuries are big response.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:44.360
 - Sentry.

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.200
 - Sentry, yeah.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.200
 - I heard it like CE and I was thinking like

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.520
 Century link and I was like,

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:52.720
 - No way we got the old street on the street

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.760
 to sponsor this, that's amazing.

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.680
 - Now, Century is our biggest sponsor.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:59.560
 You know, we got, here's the greatest part.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:04.560
 Our next three sponsors are all OCaml-related.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:08.280
 (laughing)

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.920
 - I'm sorry.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.520
 Badger the laugh, there's sponsors.

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:13.360
 Thank you so much.

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.200
 - So, actually one of them hasn't paid us hands,

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.000
 so they might end up getting the sponsorship.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.120
 - Let's put some public pressure on it.

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:19.960
 - Call them.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:20.800
 - Name them.

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:24.640
 - So, we have three OCaml-related companies

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:25.640
 that have MTJ.

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.640
 - I'm sorry.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:27.480
 - Stop it.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.320
 - There are companies.

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:30.400
 - There are three OCaml-related companies.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.760
 - Yeah, there are three OCaml-related companies.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.120
 Well, one's big, Ahh, Ahh, Ahh, Ahh, Ahh, Ahh, Ahh.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.160
 - Oh, Ahh, they just use OCaml?

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.760
 - Yeah, they use OCaml.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.640
 The other one is like an OCaml company,

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.720
 like they like, either consult OCaml stuff

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.240
 or like they do, I don't know.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:50.000
 - And then the third one is actually an individual

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.800
 that is working on OCaml stuff.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.240
 - And just wanted to sponsor?

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:57.200
 - Yeah, so tomorrow, everything that TJ and Prime

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.640
 are gonna be building, they're gonna be building it in OCaml.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.480
 - Wait a minute, yeah.

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.320
 - Hold up.

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.760
 So, okay, now I need to actually understand what OCaml is.

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.320
 It's a language.

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.160
 - Yeah.

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.000
 - Does it have a runtime?

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:07.840
 Does it compile down?

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.160
 - It's very similar to Go.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.840
 It's like, it fits the same spot as Go,

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.520
 except it's like a nice functional language.

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.120
 - And how does it fit into a web app?

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:20.400
 - Yeah, so there's been a lot of work to let you write.

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.840
 There's just, I think one of our sponsors

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.000
 who actually worked on this,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.280
 there's like a OCaml to react,

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.920
 like OCaml to like react pipeline.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.280
 So they're gonna build it in that.

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:31.600
 And again, are you guys super simple

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:32.760
 where it's not really good?

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:35.000
 - So they're building the front end in OCaml?

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.720
 - Yeah, but there's also gonna be a back end system

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:39.280
 to like receive the answers and process them with AI.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:42.440
 - In general, that would be in JavaScript.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.600
 - No, that's gonna be in OCaml too.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:44.440
 - Oh, okay.

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:47.640
 - So they've got to give me a container I can deploy

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:50.320
 and then, and that's what they'll be the back end for.

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:54.400
 - Okay, so it's actually a React app in the browser,

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.120
 but it's authored in OCaml.

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.560
 - Yeah, I don't know if that's right.

00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:00.200
 - It's what TJ was showing me was a React.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:03.360
 I think this process is just OCaml to JavaScript.

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:04.200
 - Okay.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.800
 - But also the guy that made React then made Rescript.

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.480
 I don't know if you're familiar with that.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:10.400
 - Rescript.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:14.120
 - So Rescript is a compile to JavaScript type solution,

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:14.960
 like TypeScript.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.440
 - When you say the guy who made React.

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.440
 - Jordan Block.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.480
 - Okay, I was gonna say it was like Facebook, right?

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:21.920
 So the employee Jordan.

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:22.760
 - Yeah.

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:23.680
 - Who famously was not in--

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.520
 - Is he considered--

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.400
 - He was like not in the React documentary.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:28.440
 - What, why?

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.000
 - He's crazy private.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.600
 Like he's like one of those people that's just like

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:32.680
 very, very, very, very private.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.160
 - Yeah, but he was the one that actually like

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.560
 did it as a side project or whatever.

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:36.480
 Is that the story of Facebook?

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.400
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, and then like,

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.120
 and they mentioned him a lot in the documentary.

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:40.960
 - Yeah.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.680
 - But he just isn't literally in it.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.320
 - Well, I can picture his avatar.

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:45.920
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:49.160
 So he made, then went on to work on Rescript,

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:52.200
 which is, it's not literally OCaml,

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.400
 but it's very close to OCaml, but it's its own language.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.400
 - It's like F#.

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.520
 - Yeah, similar.

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:58.400
 I mean, you're right.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.240
 - Yeah.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.080
 - And they're like, I got some things.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.160
 - You know some stuff.

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.480
 (laughing)

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.200
 Rescript is really cool.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.680
 Unfortunately, it never like took off

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.080
 and there's been like weird stuff with it

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.840
 where the language kind of got forked in.

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:10.760
 It's in this weird spot.

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:13.120
 But, point being that there's like this whole history

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:18.120
 of bringing OCaml style stuff to front end.

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.360
 There's a bunch of tooling around it.

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:23.840
 Like, I think the one that TJ is using is not this,

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:24.920
 but there's like, I know of at least

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.600
 like three projects in this category.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:27.640
 So everything this weekend,

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:29.080
 their building on stream is gonna be--

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:29.920
 - And OCaml.

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:30.760
 - OCaml.

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:31.600
 - As the-- - OCaml.

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:34.360
 - By our sponsors, the OCaml companies.

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:37.320
 - Yeah, it's just like wild 2024.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.160
 Who now?

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.800
 - Who would spend marketing dollars on this random ass event

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:43.380
 we're doing?

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:44.680
 The answer's OCaml companies.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:45.520
 - OCaml.

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:46.440
 (laughing)

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.280
 - We'll take it.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.360
 - They said, it's like, you know what you would expect?

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:50.200
 You expect Clark.

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.040
 You expect this whole thing.

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:51.880
 - Yeah.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.240
 - You expect Clark logo's up the end.

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.240
 - Why is Clark not sponsored or terrible?

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.640
 - You know what's so, you know if we were--

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.760
 So we're working on this open off JS thing.

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.120
 And we were doing just some research

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.320
 about some other library and stuff.

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.640
 - Oh, that's one of our kinds of sponsors, sorry.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.000
 (laughing)

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:05.840
 - No, that's not what.

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:06.680
 - Okay.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:07.520
 - And then we found this library.

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.400
 It was really cool when we scrolled down, it's on GitHub.

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:12.160
 We scrolled down and the first thing in the README

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:14.520
 is a big ass Clark logo.

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.840
 So we're like, wait, like Clark makes this library?

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.800
 But this seems like really competitive.

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.920
 Like, why are they wasting time on this thing?

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:23.600
 But no, they don't make the library.

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:27.440
 They just sponsor the library to be like,

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.080
 oh, we support the authentication.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:30.240
 - If you wanna roll your own.

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:32.960
 - Yeah, but like, it's the first,

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:37.200
 it's a full length width, sorry, full width of the README.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.800
 And it's like, it's all you see.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.680
 And you're just like, what the, yeah, anyway.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.160
 So we're like, I guess we could get them

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.320
 to sponsor OpenOff.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.160
 - There you go.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.040
 - But like, at some point we'll do,

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.600
 we'll go pitch Clark something

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.240
 and it's gonna be like 100K.

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:54.980
 (laughing)

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:58.360
 - I see you guys spam, like, this is gonna be 100K.

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.000
 - Oh, that's funny.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.320
 I mean, they do spend.

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.720
 That's the thing about Clark.

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:05.320
 And we all know about Clark.

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.720
 - And we'll do well for them.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.260
 They'll be one of their most successful things.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:09.160
 - I mean, I think so.

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:12.800
 I mean, there, someone at Clark is listening to try it out

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.880
 and they're like not sponsoring those assholes.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.260
 (laughing)

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:18.260
 - I love you, Jeff.

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:20.160
 (laughing)

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.880
 - Oh, Jeff from Step 4 to Clark, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:23.960
 - We go way back.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.600
 - You keep saying this about people.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.080
 Do you actually go way back?

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:29.480
 Was way back literally like React Miami?

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:30.320
 - Yeah.

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:31.160
 - Which was less than a year ago.

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:34.200
 - I think I'd actually been like, that was less than, what?

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.080
 - React Miami was less than a year ago.

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:37.080
 - Oh, yeah.

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:37.920
 That's not surprising.

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:38.760
 Is that surprising?

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:40.760
 - Doesn't it feel like solo, I mean, I don't know.

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:41.800
 It does it?

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:43.000
 - Oh, no.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.560
 I haven't had any significant events in my life.

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:47.320
 You must have had a lot of memorable things happen.

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:48.400
 - No, it was just a lot of things.

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:49.880
 - Yeah, but it was just other terminal events.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:52.280
 It was like Dallas and this and.

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:53.600
 - Yeah.

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:56.560
 I mean, it seems like, well, it was the six months ago.

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:57.400
 I guess six months.

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.920
 - March, April, May, June, July, August, September.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:00.760
 - Yeah, six.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.160
 - Something like that. - Seven months.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.200
 To me, it feels like a different era.

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.960
 - I mean, yes and no.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:12.120
 I guess like my, like being connected to anyone online

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.640
 has been like three, two and three years.

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:18.960
 So like, I don't know, that's not a very long time.

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.920
 Everything feels like pretty recent.

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:22.920
 - Okay, I mean, you're right.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.800
 It is literally not that long ago.

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:26.680
 But to me, it feels like.

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.280
 - Maybe have a lot going on.

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:30.520
 What are you guys going on?

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:31.360
 - Just this.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.680
 - Just a lot of life, terminal.

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:33.960
 - Terminal stuff, yeah.

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:36.040
 Anyway, so that's what we're doing

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.880
 because we have to do.

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:38.720
 - Today.

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:39.880
 - If you listen to this podcast,

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:43.080
 it's gonna be on a day where we've run out of time.

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:45.720
 So hopefully we've, we've done everything.

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.720
 - Hopefully we've written all the candles.

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:49.400
 I don't know the candles.

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.080
 - We've written all the candles.

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:54.760
 - It's just funny when you learn of a new language

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:57.360
 or like I've heard you talk about OCaml a million times

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.440
 and I've probably seen him ride it on stream.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:01.760
 But like, if you've never really like gone to the,

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:04.040
 read me and like started down the journey,

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.160
 you don't even know what it is.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:06.440
 Like you don't know if it's like,

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:07.280
 you know what I mean?

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:12.160
 Like, is this a thing that I can run in like a

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.320
 Lambda function or something?

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:14.160
 I don't know.

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.640
 There's not like an OCaml runtime.

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:16.880
 So is it just compiled down?

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:17.720
 I don't know.

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:18.560
 - Yeah.

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:19.400
 - It's like there's some.

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.240
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.080
 - A little bit of a last mile question.

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:21.920
 - Yeah.

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:22.840
 - How do you actually just think?

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:25.440
 Well, if you were saying about OCaml companies,

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:29.280
 there's an extremely famous OCaml company,

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.000
 James Street.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:32.820
 - Okay.

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:34.920
 I gotta say, I don't know who James Street is.

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:35.760
 - Okay, I'll tell you.

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.400
 - And I know it's like really cool because I know

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.800
 when Teach got to go there, that was like a huge deal.

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.440
 But I don't know, I don't have the context.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.920
 Like he spoke there at James Street.

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:44.760
 - Yeah.

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:46.640
 - And when he said that, I didn't know if it was a college,

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.160
 if it's a business, I don't know what it is.

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.160
 So please tell me, what is James?

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.560
 - James Street is just a hedge fund.

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:54.720
 It's just a, it's just another financial company.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.680
 Like, I mean, like we know a bunch of people

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:59.400
 that work at equivalent to James Street.

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:01.440
 But the weird cork about James Street is like,

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.480
 they went really hard in on OCaml,

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.560
 which is so random.

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:07.280
 - That's so random.

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.840
 - They must, I mean, they only do things

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.480
 for competitive advantage.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:14.360
 Like, right, hedge funds, hedge funds or no.

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:15.880
 - Yes and no, it's like--

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:16.720
 - It's awesome.

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.040
 - You can tell what sort of story you want.

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:19.560
 Like, if you talk to them, yes,

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:21.840
 they have a really great story about how

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:23.520
 this is a critical difference in success.

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.160
 And I'm sure that's true to some degree,

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.280
 but I feel like there's also hedge funds

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.880
 that do the exact same thing as them

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:29.800
 that don't use OCaml.

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.200
 So like, it's like for those people,

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.320
 it was a right choice and they were really happy with it.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.160
 That's what motivated them.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.720
 Anyway, the reason they come up a lot

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:39.520
 is because for one, I guess like,

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:41.760
 maybe they do is on purpose,

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.920
 hedge funds and companies and fines in general

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.160
 are really, really private.

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.600
 They're very private about like,

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:49.320
 anything you think is like so trivial,

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:51.560
 like they'll be like really cagey about.

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.000
 But James Street for some reason,

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.120
 like stuff like quote unquote leaks all the time.

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.680
 Like there was this thing that was going viral

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.680
 because they were looking for an intern

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.760
 and the starting salary was $250k.

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:03.160
 - The starting salary was $250k.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.000
 - For an intern.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:04.840
 - Yeah.

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:05.680
 - For an intern.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:06.520
 - Yes, for an intern.

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:07.360
 - Wow.

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.200
 - Internship.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.040
 And we'll say this is insane.

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:09.860
 This is crazy.

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:10.680
 - Talking about my intern.

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:11.680
 - Yup.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.520
 - Okay.

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:14.360
 - And we'll go nuts about it.

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:15.480
 And it's true, it's a crazy amount.

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:16.520
 So for an internship.

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:17.360
 - Remote?

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.200
 Sorry, that's not my question.

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.440
 - No, they're all in person.

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.280
 - Oh.

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.120
 - Yeah.

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:21.960
 - And in New York.

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:22.800
 - Yup.

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:23.640
 And they actually,

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:24.480
 their office was right next to my old apartment.

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.480
 I would see them all the time.

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:26.760
 - We're right next to your old apartment.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.920
 - No, no, not right next to your old workplace.

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:29.920
 - We're next to my old workplace.

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:30.760
 - Yes, yes.

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:32.520
 - But like finance is crazy.

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:35.200
 Like that's like very normal in that space.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.480
 And the ceilings are like insane.

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.040
 But like for some reason there's stuff.

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:41.700
 I think just because like they use OCaml

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:44.040
 and there's like this mystery around them.

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.840
 But yeah, that's what,

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:48.440
 and we try to get them to sponsor us.

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:52.240
 And we got a funny response.

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.600
 We were like,

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:54.960
 we have a company policy

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.520
 that we don't do sponsorships anymore

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.120
 'cause we did one and it went really badly,

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:00.640
 but we can't tell you what happened,

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.720
 but maybe I can tell you in person.

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.160
 So I'm just like, what the fuck happened?

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.080
 - That's so interesting.

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:07.520
 - But if they could sponsor us like,

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:09.160
 yeah, we got some feel like 100 times.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.720
 (laughing)

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:12.960
 - Hit funds to have money.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.480
 It's funny, our YouTube got out of sync.

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.840
 I think it missed an episode or two

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.920
 'cause I don't remember why actually.

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.040
 For some reason,

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.280
 it's like a different person puts our videos on YouTube

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.680
 versus the podcast platforms.

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.360
 And there's like, if you look at the numbers

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:28.320
 on the podcast on YouTube,

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:30.160
 there's like two or three that are missing

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.880
 and one came a week early.

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:34.040
 So it's just like totally different experience.

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:35.440
 If you listen to us on YouTube,

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:36.760
 it's just on Spotify,

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:38.400
 like you're getting a very different episode.

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.840
 - I think they might even get more listens on YouTube.

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.200
 - Probably.

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.640
 - That's gonna be crazy.

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.200
 - I don't think we do.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.360
 We get, I think we get like 1,000 views

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:50.320
 on the podcast episode on YouTube, I think.

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:51.680
 - Yeah, I guess that's probably not like a--

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:53.680
 - I wonder, does transistor count YouTube?

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:55.000
 Now we're getting into really stupid stuff.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:55.840
 - No, just--

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.080
 (laughing)

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:01.080
 - The most meta thing.

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:03.840
 - Yeah, I guess.

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.880
 - I'm excited for dinner.

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:06.720
 - Tonight.

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:07.560
 - Yeah.

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.720
 - Booked a nice Korean barbecue place as their tradition.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:10.560
 - Hope, love.

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:12.200
 - Yeah, that's become the tradition.

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.920
 - Korean barbecue, my favorite.

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.200
 (laughing)

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.720
 They always have white rice with these guys

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:19.760
 for a white guy like me.

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:20.600
 - I just veer it.

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:21.600
 I just veer it.

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:22.440
 - White rice.

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:27.520
 - It's what I call my, my Neil Hymn config, white rice.

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:28.360
 (laughing)

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:30.600
 This is me rising as a white person.

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.400
 - That's kinda confusing 'cause that makes me think

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.440
 it's gonna be in light mode, but it's not.

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:35.760
 - Nah, it's all dark red.

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.400
 - Dark rice, brown rice, that's what I mean.

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.600
 - Dark rice, it's an eight o'clock,

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:43.080
 which is totally normal to have dinner at eight o'clock.

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:43.920
 - Did you see my,

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:47.000
 we got a dinner reservation of the day at 11 p.m.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:47.840
 - I did see that.

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:48.840
 - I'm so fucking cool.

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.840
 - I'm solid, I'm 11 p.m.

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.880
 - That's insane. - And you know where it was?

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:57.280
 It was at the Korean barbecue place that we went to.

00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:58.120
 (laughing)

00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:58.960
 - It was the one in Miami.

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.200
 - Yeah, that was a nice place.

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.040
 - It's when everything was--

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:02.160
 - You were there at like 11 p.m. at nine.

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.160
 - Yeah, every time I go there, the waiters are like,

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.000
 "Have you been here before?"

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.800
 I'm like, "Have you been here so many times?"

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:09.400
 With like every person I know,

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.560
 every person I know in my life, I have taken them here.

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:12.400
 - Remember me.

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.160
 (laughing)

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.520
 - 11 p.m., that's just,

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.440
 you're just trying to make a statement at that point.

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.960
 There's no reason to eat at 11 p.m.

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.600
 Unless you just wanna be cool.

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:22.480
 - Well, what happened was,

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.520
 no, I was just really craving,

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:27.160
 after eating steak for two months straight,

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.000
 two meals a day--

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000
 - Oh man, you wanna hear more about that.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.800
 - I was just craving more steak.

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:34.240
 So, I was like this, we have to go here today,

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:35.080
 and the only sloppy.

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:35.920
 How was 11?

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.040
 - Can we talk about the steak thing?

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:39.400
 So, you've been eating, I heard you say this,

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:40.800
 been eating exclusively steak.

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:43.160
 Like, you don't have like cereal for breakfast.

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:44.000
 - Nope.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:44.840
 - Like, all you eat.

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:45.800
 - Well, it's still steak.

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:49.120
 - There's, it's not like, it's not religious,

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:52.480
 so there's, like during the weekdays,

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:55.240
 I pretty much do groceries for enough

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:58.160
 for two steak meals for every single day,

00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.200
 for five to six days.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.720
 - So, eat stuff with the steak.

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.080
 - I will have the vegetables.

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.360
 - Make vegetables, okay.

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:05.040
 - But at the end of the weekends, you know,

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:06.560
 we might go out, we might do other things.

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:07.400
 - Yeah.

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:09.960
 - I'm not like just sticking to it that crazy,

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:13.920
 but, so I was just like, I wanna try this,

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:15.400
 I wanna see how I feel.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:16.240
 - Yeah.

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.080
 - Like, do what I feel like that.

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:19.560
 - What about the nutrition side, then it is like,

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:21.120
 you just really like steak and you wanna eat.

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:23.320
 - Well, I also think it's one of the most delicious things

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:26.080
 to eat, especially if you get really good at cooking it,

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:26.920
 which I have gotten.

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:27.760
 - That's the other thing,

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:29.480
 you're trying to practice making it better.

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:30.320
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:33.120
 And I've like, I've like narrowed down my style,

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:36.320
 and I'm hitting like some crazy levels of steak quality now.

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:38.840
 It's a point where when we were at that Korean barbecue place,

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:40.840
 I was like, this is good,

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.920
 but some of these things are actually worse

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:45.120
 than some of the stuff that I've made,

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:46.400
 which I'm like, that's pretty cool to get to.

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.560
 - Where do you get your steak?

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.160
 You said sourcing, you said that earlier.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.000
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:51.840
 - That's the hard part.

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:52.800
 - So I have two sources.

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:56.400
 One is this Argentinian farm that someone in the--

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:57.400
 - I don't know what it would.

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:58.760
 (laughing)

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:00.360
 - This isn't something that I did.

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:03.120
 Somebody, have you visited this farm in Argentina?

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.080
 - No, no, no, no.

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.920
 Somebody in like the '60s,

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:10.920
 there was like a wave of migration from Cuba to the US.

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:13.400
 And maybe there was maybe people came from Argentina,

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:14.240
 I'm not exactly sure.

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:18.760
 Anyway, the Graziano family arrived in Miami

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:22.360
 with nothing but two pennies to rub together,

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:24.480
 without even two pennies to rub together.

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:27.200
 And they set up this business that was a restaurant

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.920
 slash markets that was a steakhouse

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:33.440
 and they set up a supply chain from Argentinian farms.

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.280
 - Interesting.

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.320
 - And Argentina is known for really good cattle?

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:37.920
 - Well, yeah, I feel like,

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:40.000
 is there like, are there Argentina steakhouses?

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:40.840
 Is that a thing?

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:41.920
 - Well, they're Australian steakhouses

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.280
 would sound very similar to Argentina.

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:44.800
 - I think I've seen Argentina.

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:45.640
 - Okay, yeah.

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:46.800
 - Argentinian?

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:49.920
 - Now I'm adding myself and I'm not actually seeing it.

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:51.920
 - So they set up this business and it's doing really well

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:53.600
 in Miami, they have so many locations now,

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.560
 it's been around for like 50 or 60 years.

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:59.120
 So they set up this pipeline and what's great is

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:00.720
 they have a market, so you just go to the market

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:04.480
 and get really good steak from Argentina

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:07.040
 for like, not that expensive.

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:09.920
 Which, so that's one source.

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.040
 The thing, so I've also gone to beef grating.

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:15.440
 Here's what's, here's what's crazy to me, okay?

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:17.240
 - You think?

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:18.080
 - What's the subreddit?

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:18.920
 I gotta know.

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:19.760
 - No subreddit.

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:20.600
 - Oh, okay.

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:21.440
 - I mean, I'm not, I'm not even.

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:22.280
 - I think everything has a subreddit.

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:23.120
 - The subreddit's not even good enough.

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:23.960
 - Oh, not even good enough.

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:24.800
 - You're gonna have to pass it.

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:25.640
 - You're gonna have to pass it.

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:26.880
 - The old school forums.

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.680
 - So, we're like, okay, there's grades of beef.

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:30.520
 Obviously there's grades of beef.

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:31.360
 - Yeah.

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.200
 - That makes total sense, you know?

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.440
 - Choice, like, selective choice prime, et cetera.

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.160
 You like, learn all that stuff.

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.160
 But then you start thinking about it,

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:39.440
 you're like, wait, this is a government agency.

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:43.760
 It says USDA, we literally established a government agency

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:47.360
 to be like, that steak is good, that steak is better.

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:48.200
 - Yeah, how do I know?

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:49.800
 - It's like, it's very simple.

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.680
 Like, 90% of it is based off the marbling,

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:55.560
 which is like, how much intramuscular fat is there?

00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:57.040
 And you can visually see like--

00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:58.600
 - You want more or less?

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:02.200
 - So, prime is the most amount of intramuscular fat

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:05.480
 for American cattle, and that's the best.

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:07.720
 If you find prime cuts, you should buy it,

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.240
 especially if it's at a good price.

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:12.440
 This Argentinian place I go to, if I want ribeyes,

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:14.120
 again, I got into like the different cuts and everything.

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.440
 - And I want to get into that, too.

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.280
 So, I have that question.

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:18.600
 - The ribeyes are like the most traditionally popular.

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:20.400
 Can you imagine a steak from a steakhouse?

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.560
 You'd probably imagine a ribeye.

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:23.680
 I think it's a little overrated,

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:25.240
 'cause it's just the most popular.

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.360
 But it is quite good.

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.880
 The Argentinian place does not do prime ribeye,

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:31.800
 and they save that for the restaurant.

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.520
 So, their prime cuts a little bit like--

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:35.840
 - So, prime rib, that's what prime rib is.

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:38.120
 It's a prime grade ribeye?

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:41.520
 - No, prime rib is a little confusing,

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:42.800
 'cause they just call it prime rib,

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:45.480
 but you can ask like prime grade prime rib,

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:46.800
 or you can-- - Oh, geez, okay.

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:49.040
 So, prime rib is a different cut.

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:49.880
 - So, I'm trying to think,

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:54.000
 I think a prime rib is actually a full ribeye.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.880
 A prime rib is like this giant piece,

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.760
 and if you cut it into one-inch slices,

00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:59.360
 those are ribeye steaks.

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:00.200
 - Oh, okay.

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:02.040
 - I think, I'm like-- - Okay.

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:02.880
 - I'm gonna get an exact terminal.

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:03.720
 - What's your favorite cut?

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.240
 I want to know, I gotta know.

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:06.120
 - Well, the ribeye's great.

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:07.160
 I think it's a great choice.

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:09.360
 And I've been doing a lot of flaps steak,

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:13.160
 'cause the Argentinian place has a prime grade flaps steak,

00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:16.240
 and it's pretty good, and the price is great,

00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:18.000
 but there's last two weeks,

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.160
 I went to my second source, which is wild fork.

00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:22.440
 Wild fork is a little bit more accessible,

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:23.920
 there's probably a wild fork,

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:25.360
 not in the tunnel locations,

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:28.240
 but they're like all over the place in a country.

00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:30.080
 They source really good meat,

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:33.240
 and they immediately flat flash freeze it, like right away.

00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:35.720
 So, the thing with meat is the faster you freeze it,

00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:39.120
 the less, like if you put raw meat into your freezer,

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:39.920
 it's gonna destroy it.

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.480
 It's gonna slowly freeze it,

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:43.320
 which like crystallizes too much,

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:44.680
 and like fucks up everything.

00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:46.600
 So, if you flat freeze it, or blast freeze it,

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:49.240
 I think they call it, it's like a really good way

00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:50.560
 to freeze and preserve the meat,

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:52.600
 and they ship it straight to their stores,

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:54.280
 and you can go, and they actually deliver your house,

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:57.080
 whatever, so you can get some really good cuts there,

00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:59.680
 again, decent price.

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:01.200
 So, every week on Sunday,

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:04.160
 I will get a week's worth of steak.

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:08.400
 So, if I do rib eyes, I'll get like five rib eyes,

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:11.280
 and I'll cut them in half, and have one half for each meal.

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:12.120
 - Okay.

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:13.120
 - Yeah.

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:15.040
 And I've been getting crazy to cooking it.

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.520
 It's been about, I've been like my mom visited

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:19.040
 for like 10 days, or she was cooking,

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:20.320
 and like, so I've been on and off it,

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:22.200
 but pretty much for two months,

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.680
 I haven't had mostly steak for any meal.

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:25.360
 - Yeah, and hat, what do you have here?

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:28.200
 - Totally normal, which is good.

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.720
 Like, it's not like I degraded anything.

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:31.120
 I'll probably need to do blood work to see,

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:33.280
 like how it's impacted certain things.

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:34.520
 - People that eat,

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:36.160
 I don't think I'm eating enough of this to be a case,

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:40.680
 but people that eat a lot of meat to like carnivore diets,

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:41.960
 they have high iron.

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:43.280
 - I was gonna guess iron.

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:44.880
 - Okay, so they get too much iron in their blood.

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:45.720
 - Yeah.

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:47.560
 - Super simple fix, they just donate blood.

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:48.920
 They literally donate blood.

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:50.640
 - Huh, it's like your blood factory.

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:51.480
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:52.280
 - Like a healthy blood factory.

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:53.720
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:55.760
 So, if it's too high, it's donate blood.

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:56.600
 - Yeah.

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:58.760
 - It's fixed, so I feel great.

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:01.920
 The one noticeable plus thing is,

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:05.280
 my knees feel like I'm like a high schooler again.

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:08.040
 Like, I'm just used to like, if I'm like squatting

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:09.400
 and I get up, it's just like,

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:10.480
 my knees aren't happy about it.

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:11.320
 - Yeah, crack on me, pop.

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:13.120
 - Yeah, and there is still some crackling there,

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:15.320
 but there's like no more like discomfort.

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:16.800
 And I'm like, this is interesting.

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:17.880
 I don't know if it's 100% related,

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:20.200
 but that is the one change I've noticed.

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:21.160
 Other than that, totally normal,

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.520
 I asked Shaq DPT, I was like,

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:25.720
 if I only eat steak, what am I missing?

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:27.760
 Like what, I was like, what, one other,

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:30.000
 okay, because that was crazy, I was like,

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.400
 I'm gonna only eat steak.

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:33.200
 I'm willing to eat one other food.

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:36.880
 What should it be to balance out what I'm missing from the steak?

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:37.720
 - Yeah.

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:38.560
 - And it's a sweet potato.

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:39.400
 It's a sweet potato.

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:40.320
 Here's all things steak has.

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:41.360
 And steak is like a super food.

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:42.560
 It has almost everything you need.

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:44.800
 And then sweet potatoes, everything else.

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.840
 But I was like, I don't want something high carb.

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:48.080
 What's something low carb I can do?

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:49.800
 And they're like, okay, if you're willing to eat

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:54.600
 three foods total, eggs and broccoli,

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:56.240
 you got everything you need.

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:58.440
 So I literally just eat steak and broccoli

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:01.280
 and those will make eggs for breakfast occasionally, so.

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.480
 - I've always realized I haven't.

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:05.800
 - You said UPT in a very long time.

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:08.120
 I forgot about Chad UPT.

00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:08.960
 - Wow.

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:10.620
 - I mean, I use AI coding assistant stuff.

00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:11.460
 - Okay.

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:12.300
 - Yeah.

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:14.840
 - When I say Chad UPT, I use cloud a lot.

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:15.960
 - Oh, like in the browser?

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:16.800
 - Yeah.

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.360
 - I just, I'm realizing I haven't asked normal life stuff.

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:22.160
 I've only used coding assistants.

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.000
 - Really?

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:23.820
 - For months.

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:25.440
 - I hate using Google now.

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:26.280
 - Really?

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:29.040
 - I like start to Google something, I just switch over.

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.880
 'Cause I'm like, if it's not gonna give me the exact answer

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:31.760
 right away, like.

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:33.560
 - And you feel like there's,

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:35.920
 where are we at in like hallucinations?

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:38.160
 That was really bad in the early, early, early era.

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:40.720
 - It's still about the same, but like, it's fine.

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:41.640
 It's like for the stuff.

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:42.640
 - It's looking out.

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:44.160
 - Is cloud like connected?

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.840
 Is it like up to date or is it?

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:47.640
 - No, April 2024, I think.

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:48.640
 - Yeah.

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:49.480
 - Yeah.

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:50.320
 - Yeah.

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:51.240
 - I just can't live ever got about them.

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:52.080
 - That's pretty crazy.

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:53.080
 - I used to use them in everyday life.

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:55.000
 - That's an interesting data point.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:55.840
 - Yeah.

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:56.680
 And I just, am I weird?

00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:57.520
 I'm probably the outlier.

00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:59.360
 - It's still an interesting data point.

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:01.400
 If there's one of you, there must be more of you.

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:04.840
 - We were using it for like, some schooling stuff.

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:08.440
 And like, definitely it was part of my routine.

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:10.000
 - Well, you thought it was schedule D.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.480
 I'd literally have insight in months.

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:15.040
 - There's some data analytic data point

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:16.920
 in their database being.

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:17.760
 - Yeah.

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:18.600
 What did we do?

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:19.720
 - We lost this customer.

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:20.560
 - Yeah.

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:21.400
 Reengage.

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:22.240
 How do we do that?

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.080
 - I'll ask you.

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:23.920
 - Huh.

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:26.520
 - Yeah.

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:29.040
 So anyway, but the other thing I wanted to say is,

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:31.000
 I was telling you it's earlier,

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.720
 I've been devouring YouTube content about cooking steak.

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:34.560
 - Yeah.

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:35.960
 - And I've tried, I found this guy,

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:37.840
 and I feel like it's the type of thing that you like.

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:40.120
 There's so many myths around steak.

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:42.800
 They're like, when you cook it, like don't touch it.

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:44.840
 Like, let it completely finish one side

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:45.960
 and then flip to the other side after.

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:48.200
 Or like, the pan has to be really, really hot.

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:49.600
 Or like, once you're done cooking,

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:50.440
 you have to let it rest.

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:51.680
 Don't come into it for whatever.

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:55.440
 And he does these crazy ass science experiments to like,

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:57.680
 his views are so well produced and like, you know,

00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:00.200
 it's so good to like bust all these myths

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:02.160
 and figure out like he'll do like these different tests

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:04.120
 and compare different things.

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:06.400
 Just figure out like, here's what actually happens.

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:08.120
 The most interesting thing I've learned recently,

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:10.720
 and this is that a huge impact on the way I cook

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:14.640
 and the way I understand how steak cooks is almost,

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:15.840
 obviously there's like a limit to this,

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:20.840
 but whether it's medium heat, high heat, whatever,

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:24.920
 the heat does not make it to the center of the steak faster.

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:26.920
 Whether if you put it on high heat or medium heat

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:31.920
 or even like low heat, a steak will always need 10 minutes

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:35.440
 to cook on the inside to medium, medium well,

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:36.920
 or like medium rare.

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:38.240
 - No matter the temperature?

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.960
 - Yes, no matter how, there's obviously a limit,

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:42.160
 like you're putting it in like, fucking furnace.

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.160
 (laughing)

00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:45.240
 But for most cooking temperatures.

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:46.080
 - And all these things.

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:47.560
 - Yeah, so here's the mistake people make.

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:50.600
 People make it really hot to try to get that char

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:52.640
 on the outside, 'cause the outside will cook differently

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:55.960
 depending on how you suppose, or the temperature.

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:58.720
 And they'll be like, oh, nice, I got the char,

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:00.720
 then I have to wait for the inside to reach temperature

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:02.000
 and then the outside gets burnt.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:02.840
 - Yeah.

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:03.680
 - And the inside is correct.

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:05.760
 Or they'll like, think it's done,

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:06.680
 'cause the outside looks done,

00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:08.880
 they'll cut into it and it'll be like way too raw.

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:13.160
 So the trick with cooking steak is my approach has been,

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:15.760
 I cook it in high heat to get,

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:17.600
 and now I can eyeball it to get the right level

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:19.720
 of crispiness on the outside.

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:22.120
 Then I go back down to low or medium heat

00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:25.640
 to let the inside temperature come up to the level I want.

00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.560
 And the outside isn't getting it really any crispier

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:28.920
 at that point. - Yeah.

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:32.520
 - And the second trick is, I use beef tallow.

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:33.600
 - What is that?

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:35.400
 - It is the weirdest thing ever.

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:38.720
 - Is it like the joint, in between the joints or something?

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:41.320
 - No, no, it's made out of, that's collagen.

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:44.560
 That's what they go with, or something like that.

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:45.880
 - Yeah.

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:47.320
 - So if you look at beef tallow,

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:50.400
 it looks like, it comes in these big tubs.

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:52.640
 It looks like a tub of like melted plastic

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:55.760
 or like something that just does not look,

00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:57.560
 like it came from nature in any form.

00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:58.560
 - Yeah.

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:00.080
 - But it is like butter,

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:02.520
 like one of the oldest forms of fat that people--

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:03.360
 - I'll count it around.

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:04.560
 - It's made from-- - It's like lard.

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:06.560
 - It's like lard, but the lard that comes from a cow,

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:09.160
 but it has this crazy weird like,

00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:11.760
 kind of almost alien consistency.

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:15.200
 Liz has been putting it on her face for a very long time.

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:16.640
 People, it's like really good for skin care.

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:17.640
 - Yeah.

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:20.360
 - But now I've been putting it into my pan.

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:21.840
 - Like that's like instead of butter.

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:23.160
 - Instead of butter oil, yeah.

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:26.040
 So just a very little amount.

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:28.680
 And that gives it a really nice sear

00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:32.240
 and just makes your steak taste like super, super good.

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:35.200
 - Just kind of accentuates the beef taste.

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:37.240
 - Yeah, but adding more beefiness to it.

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:39.120
 (laughing)

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:40.800
 And it has a nice like saltiness, like it's good.

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:43.920
 I've also nailed how much you need to salt it.

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:47.080
 Another weird thing, you literally cannot over salt a steak.

00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:48.840
 Like it's just like so hard, like you know,

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:50.200
 'cause everyone's salting thinks you're so bored,

00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:51.040
 you're gonna ruin it.

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:51.880
 - Yeah.

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:53.840
 - It can take a lot of salt, like just go crazy.

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:55.440
 There's a whole thing with like you salt it,

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:56.800
 then you let the salt drop the water,

00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:57.880
 then you dry the water.

00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:00.320
 So there's all of like that, that precision.

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:02.600
 The last thing I wanna say is,

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:03.720
 some of those grading system,

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:05.600
 again, really weird that US government is like,

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:08.160
 we need to make sure that as a people,

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:10.680
 as a government that we are grading our beef correctly.

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:15.040
 So like I said, it's all about the intramuscular fat, right?

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:19.400
 And prime is the highest in American breeds.

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:22.800
 But there are breeds that have an insane amount

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:25.440
 of intramuscular fat, like a crazy amount

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:28.280
 where you look at the steak and it looks white, okay?

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:32.160
 Japanese cow, wagyu, pucker, wagyu beef.

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:33.000
 - Wagyu, I've heard of that.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.720
 - So there's a breed of cattle in Japan

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:40.160
 that for whatever weird genetic reason,

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:43.400
 it has like this insane amount of fat

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:47.400
 in its body.

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:49.760
 - Yeah. - And these steaks are crazy expensive

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:50.800
 because they produce so little of it

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:55.320
 and it's probably like, I would say it's a 10x price difference.

00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:56.240
 - Oh wow.

00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:58.360
 - But if you try to eat it, 'cause people are like,

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:00.360
 oh wagyu, good, let me get a wagyu steak,

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:02.400
 you literally cannot eat more than like two bites.

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:04.000
 - Oh, it is, it's just so bad.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.240
 - It's so rich, it's great as like an appetizer,

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:08.880
 have like two pieces trying to just like

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:11.200
 this like exotic, interesting thing.

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:12.400
 But like people buy a lot of it

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.560
 and they're just like, like they could sit.

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:16.040
 It is like really enriching.

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:19.960
 It is very delicious if you like that like soft fatty-ness.

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:22.720
 And obviously that can't work on this grading scale

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:24.400
 'cause that's just like, you know, like the chart.

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:25.560
 - Yeah.

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:29.040
 - But the brilliant thing is people have brought over

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:31.920
 wagyu cattle to the U.S.

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:34.600
 and crossbred them with American cattle.

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:37.440
 - So tell you how a little bit of such a muscular fat.

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:40.560
 - Yes, there's now American wagyu and Australian wagyu

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:42.240
 and that's also off the chart,

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:44.240
 but it's like in a more reasonable place

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:45.880
 and you're guaranteed to get like,

00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:49.560
 like every single wagyu cattle is like prime or plus.

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:51.200
 - Yeah, 'cause it's genetic.

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:54.000
 - It's toned down from this crazy amount

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.680
 but it's still way more than a prime.

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:56.520
 - Yep.

00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:59.200
 And the cost there is maybe like two to three acts

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.880
 of a normal time-stake, so.

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:03.560
 - You're telling me there's a single subreddit

00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:06.320
 you've been perusing for any of this information.

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:08.200
 - So I will end up on subreddits

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:10.280
 through like specific questions I've Googled.

00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:13.080
 But again, I just go to Claude or stuff

00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:15.920
 to ask these questions. (laughing)

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:18.160
 - But do you hang out on any subreddits?

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:19.800
 This is a question I can't believe we've never talked

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:20.800
 about this, I don't think we've heard.

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:23.160
 - I used to use Reddit like years and years and years

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:25.160
 and years ago, maybe when I'm even before I was an adult,

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:26.400
 but I just, he's done it.

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.360
 - Well, you know like I end up on Reddit

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:30.440
 that I think what you said, like from Google.

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:31.960
 I asked a specific question on Google,

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:34.320
 Reddit answers are usually pretty good for stuff like that

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:36.400
 'cause it's a lot of knowledgeable people.

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:39.240
 But every time you end up in Reddit from some Google search,

00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:40.760
 you get this sense that there's like people

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:42.040
 that just live on that thing.

00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:44.680
 And they're like the people, not even the moderators,

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:46.320
 just like the people who have all the knowledge

00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:47.280
 about this thing.

00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:48.120
 - Yep.

00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:49.920
 - And like, what is it like out of the world?

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:50.760
 - That's a good expert.

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:52.640
 - Yeah, and they have like this community of people

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:54.600
 that they probably hang out with on Reddit every day.

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:57.560
 - That's awesome, that's literally us, just not on Reddit.

00:44:57.560 --> 00:44:59.680
 - But yeah, that's what's weird to me though,

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:01.800
 is like I can't imagine that being Reddit

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:03.280
 as opposed to like Twitter.

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:07.080
 Twitter or Discord or whatever feels very natural to me

00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:10.200
 and it just seems so foreign to imagine Reddit being the place.

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:12.560
 - Yeah, like I send a lot of messages and read a lot of messages

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:13.400
 and whatever.

00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:14.400
 - Yeah, it's a little old school, it's like foreign.

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:15.920
 - It's old school, yeah.

00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:17.520
 - Yeah, it's more of a foreign thing.

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:18.360
 - Yeah.

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:21.520
 - So I will say the stake world of Reddit,

00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:24.600
 I haven't found to be that good, I think.

00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:27.160
 I'm gonna be a little honest.

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:30.040
 I'm gonna be a little honest and maybe a little snobby here.

00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:34.320
 This is like an expensive hobby, I would say.

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:36.520
 - You're calling Reddit a land of the poorest.

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:41.520
 - It's like, there's like an angle to this

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:44.280
 'cause like any state can be a good state.

00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:45.920
 So they tend to focus in a specific zone

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:49.440
 of like practical like, you know, whatever.

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:53.240
 And I just find like, it's a little too narrow.

00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:55.520
 So I wanted like a wider, wider experience.

00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:58.440
 - You just backed off from calling Reddit people poor people.

00:45:58.440 --> 00:45:59.280
 Why?

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:01.640
 Why did you, you went so far and then you just pulled it off.

00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:04.920
 - No, you just, did I pull it back?

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:06.440
 I mean, you didn't really call out

00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:10.320
 that you were basically saying you have expensive taste.

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:11.760
 - Oh wait, here's the thing, right?

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:14.720
 Like the problem is, someone brings up Wagyu, right?

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:17.720
 The immediate comment is, it's a scam.

00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:19.320
 I don't know why people pay so much for this.

00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:20.160
 - It's a little Reddit.

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:22.000
 - And just like, you know.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.920
 So it's like, they are right that the online sentiment

00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:28.320
 is like, yeah, buying a Wagyu steak makes no sense.

00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:30.840
 But I'm still very interested in Wagyu

00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:33.160
 and like learning all about that and like all this stuff.

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:34.360
 And it's just like, they like shut down

00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:37.360
 'cause they see this obvious reply of being like,

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:38.200
 Wagyu's not worth it.

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:40.440
 I prefer like, I really understand the stuff

00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:42.520
 so I prefer that they're not for tourists.

00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:44.520
 So there's a little bit too much like I'm trying to prove

00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:47.360
 something about my identity on Reddit.

00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:49.960
 - Earlier in the car on the way over to Manhattan

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:52.040
 from the airport, what was it?

00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:55.520
 Who asked like, where's the first place you would go in New York?

00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:57.400
 Could Liz ask you that?

00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:58.640
 If it was your first time in New York

00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:00.480
 where the first place you would say to me?

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:01.320
 - Yeah.

00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:03.000
 - And I just so bad they wanted to be like,

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.400
 the entire state of the way.

00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:05.920
 - Oh, we said Times Square.

00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:06.760
 - Oh, really?

00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:08.400
 Is that, that's not too touristy for you?

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:09.240
 - No, no.

00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:10.080
 - Or you're saying the taste of somebody?

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:10.920
 - The question was ask someone

00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:13.400
 that never didn't know about New York.

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:14.240
 - Oh.

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:15.080
 - Yeah.

00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:15.920
 - Oh yeah.

00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:16.760
 - We just go to the tourist bar.

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:17.600
 - That's why you were saying, okay.

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:21.880
 - That's so your personality is to like not do touristy things.

00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:22.720
 - Yeah.

00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:24.040
 I generally don't do touristy things.

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:26.720
 But I just find them, I just hate being around crowds

00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:28.880
 of people that are like, yeah.

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:29.800
 It's the whole thing.

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:30.640
 - Yeah.

00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:32.080
 I hate feeling like I'm a guy on vacation

00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:34.040
 and being around people that are guys on vacation.

00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:35.440
 - No, I am sobbing about that too.

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:36.920
 Like there's a legionnaire.

00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:39.440
 I think I've talked about the like budget airline

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:40.360
 that flies out of Springfield.

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:41.200
 - Yeah.

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:42.040
 - They don't have first class

00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:44.000
 and it's like everybody's in Hawaiian shirts

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.720
 and it's like, you know, like inflatable poll toys

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:48.720
 are ready to go to the beach and like, that's every flight.

00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:50.400
 So if you go on a work trip on a leisure flight,

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:51.160
 you're just like,

00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:54.600
 I got my laptop and I'm doing a work

00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:57.760
 and dad's throwing whatever across the point.

00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:58.600
 Yeah.

00:47:58.600 --> 00:47:59.440
 - Yeah.

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:00.280
 - It's a party bus.

00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:01.600
 So you might wonder why I would want to sit

00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:04.040
 and listen to you talk about steak for 15 minutes

00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:06.080
 when I'm a vegan of 12 years.

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:09.720
 And I find it very fascinating anytime somebody's

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:10.720
 really into something.

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:11.560
 - Yeah.

00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:14.840
 - And there's just, it's like every single thing in the world,

00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:17.080
 there are lots of people into that thing.

00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:17.920
 I just love that.

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:18.760
 I think that's what I like about Reddit.

00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:20.680
 I don't get on Reddit, but I like the idea

00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:22.840
 that there's subreddits for everything.

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:23.680
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:24.520
 - And every time I learn a new subreddit,

00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:26.320
 it's like, of course there's a subreddit for that.

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:28.400
 There's people who are moderators

00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:29.560
 of a subreddit for that thing.

00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:31.800
 And I've never thought about that thing for more than five

00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:32.640
 seconds, you know what I mean?

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:33.480
 I just love that.

00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:35.440
 - It's all just fun to get hooked on something.

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:36.800
 - It's so fun.

00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:39.440
 - And now that YouTube, I'm not a big,

00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:42.520
 I just, it's totally, I haven't been a big YouTube person,

00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:44.440
 but I've wanted to understand it better

00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:47.880
 and understand, okay, here's what well-produced

00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:49.440
 stuff on YouTube looks like.

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:52.680
 But I never had a thing that I could actually direct on.

00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:54.480
 So now I have this and I've been watching

00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:55.560
 a ton of YouTube.

00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:57.040
 - Yeah, I've actually been watching it

00:48:57.040 --> 00:49:02.040
 on YouTube too, not really, but I know,

00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:05.360
 I think I've been in the same space as you

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:07.400
 of like seeing the algorithm figure you out

00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:08.960
 and just need you stuff that you want.

00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:13.960
 And mine's all like, oh, my Christmas lights are up.

00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:15.840
 I just got a garage modification

00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:17.680
 and you can see my Christmas lights.

00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:18.680
 - Wait, but what do you mean they're up?

00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:19.880
 They're just up themselves?

00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:21.680
 - No, a guy comes and puts them on.

00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:22.520
 - Okay.

00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:23.360
 - I'm lazy there.

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:25.560
 I don't put my own Christmas lights on.

00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:27.800
 He stores them for me too, like he does the whole neighborhood.

00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:30.760
 I mean, he just comes by and like puts them up,

00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:33.040
 takes them down at the end of the year,

00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:35.240
 stores them, whatever, all our Reese.

00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:37.040
 It's really nice, I'll send you a picture.

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:39.080
 I've been watching YouTube to learn

00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:40.980
 about my messed up brain.

00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:42.600
 (laughing)

00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:45.200
 Complex trauma, you ever heard of complex trauma?

00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:46.040
 - No.

00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:48.040
 - Basically, everyone in our generation has complex trauma

00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:50.160
 because boomers are the worst.

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:51.440
 Can I say things like that?

00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:56.440
 - No, my parents maybe are like the age of boomers,

00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:59.520
 but they're not--

00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:00.360
 - We're like--

00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:02.040
 - Well, they didn't grow up in a marriage scene.

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:03.840
 - Oh, yes, they would be fine.

00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:05.640
 Yeah, you don't have complex trauma then.

00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:07.200
 If you're, yeah, probably people--

00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:08.040
 - No, no, I do.

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:09.360
 - Which is coming from a couple of--

00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:11.000
 - Have you ever heard of the term?

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.080
 - No, is this making you uncomfortable?

00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:13.920
 Do you wanna talk?

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:15.960
 - No, it's okay, can we talk about mental health?

00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:18.200
 (laughing)

00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:22.120
 - No, I'm just learning all this stuff about,

00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:25.840
 have you ever heard of roles in dysfunctional families?

00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:26.680
 - Yeah.

00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:27.760
 - All the different roles?

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:32.320
 Man, I fit one to the T, like the exact everything

00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:33.160
 I read about it.

00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:34.840
 Is that like horoscopes though, is it like everything you--

00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:37.200
 - No, no, no, no, I think what's interesting

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:40.600
 about horoscopes and these stereotypical things are,

00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:45.320
 sometimes you find yourself in a very common situation

00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:48.040
 so that these horoscopes like things

00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:49.600
 end up describing it very accurately.

00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:50.440
 - Yeah.

00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:52.000
 - We talked about it before,

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.080
 whenever I take a personality test,

00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:55.560
 not just me, other people read it

00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:57.560
 and they're like, this sounds like it was written about you

00:50:57.560 --> 00:50:58.400
 and I think it's just,

00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:02.200
 I have a very like standard, well-defined personality

00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:03.040
 that's existed.

00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:04.120
 I think maybe you're in a role.

00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:04.960
 - An archetype, yeah.

00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:06.360
 - Yeah, that's very common.

00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:08.280
 - Yeah, it's a whole thing.

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:10.640
 I just could not say, like I've been on YouTube a lot

00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:11.720
 and I'm not a YouTube bit,

00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:15.480
 like I don't watch YouTube that much before this.

00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:17.240
 But now there's like a few different people

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:18.880
 that make videos about this stuff

00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:21.240
 and I've watched like everything they make.

00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:22.480
 It's very interesting.

00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:24.640
 It's very interesting to feel like I'm 38

00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:26.080
 and I'm learning things I should've known

00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:28.440
 when I was like, you shouldn't know when you were 20.

00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:30.800
 I feel like, did any 20-year-old really know anything

00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:34.800
 where now, maybe when you were 30, but you are 30.

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:37.440
 - It is interesting, I've had this thought

00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:39.480
 and I haven't put it into words with my brain

00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:42.040
 but I've had this feeling of like,

00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:44.160
 does anybody take advantage of their 20s?

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:47.600
 - I feel like everyone says like, wasted my 20s.

00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:48.800
 Did everyone waste your 20s?

00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:50.080
 - I don't think I wasted my 20s.

00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:51.480
 - Maybe it's not wasting even,

00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:54.080
 if everybody kind of has the same experience in their 20s.

00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:55.240
 What did you do in your 20s?

00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:57.800
 - Okay, here's this really clear thing

00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:00.640
 that's very clear to me in hindsight.

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:03.800
 I felt my brain like develop.

00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:05.880
 I can like physically feel it develop.

00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:07.920
 Like when I was like 26 or 27

00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:10.440
 because when I think back to everything before that,

00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:12.200
 I was like a crazy person.

00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:16.160
 Like, clearly, like, adulthood doesn't really happen too.

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:18.560
 And this is like biologically, this is a thing,

00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:20.120
 like the whole frontal lobe thing.

00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:22.240
 - And it's maybe different for males and females,

00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:24.320
 but I know I've heard something about the male brain.

00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:26.640
 Does it fully develop until it's like late 20s?

00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:29.720
 - Yeah, it's like, what the fuck was I doing?

00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:32.120
 The way I operated and none of it made any sense

00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:32.960
 of looking back.

00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:33.960
 And I'm like, that's just what I was like.

00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:35.880
 And I guess my brain developed at some point

00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:37.840
 and it became less crazy.

00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:40.080
 But I don't think I wasted it.

00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:42.000
 Like what, I spent a lot of time working,

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.180
 which is fine.

00:52:43.180 --> 00:52:44.020
 - Yeah, same.

00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:46.000
 - Do you have zero responsibilities, like nothing?

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:46.840
 Like it's a great thing.

00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:48.360
 - Yeah, I guess you kind of built your foundation.

00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:50.480
 - Yeah, I was in New York the whole time.

00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:52.640
 I had like a ton of friends, like, you know.

00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:53.700
 - Okay, well now you're just bragging.

00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:56.160
 You're revving in, 'cause I didn't have any of those things.

00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:57.400
 - I guess you wasted your 20s at 'em.

00:52:57.400 --> 00:52:58.240
 - I wasted my 20s.

00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:00.040
 - Well, I did, I worked a lot.

00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:03.600
 Well, what I was gonna say before you just were like,

00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:04.680
 my 20s were awesome.

00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:06.360
 I was the best.

00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:07.920
 Before you said that, I was gonna say,

00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:10.440
 maybe it's just a reframing in that we all say

00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:12.720
 we wasted our 20s, all of us normies,

00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:14.600
 because we're looking at it wrong.

00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:19.600
 We wouldn't say we wasted our years four to 10.

00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:23.720
 I wouldn't be like, I wasted my teens.

00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:27.520
 Like, maybe it's just like, you need to push back the bar.

00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:29.400
 And like, nothing really good happens in your 20s.

00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:30.640
 - But you're helping me see the--

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:31.880
 - I think it's brain development thing.

00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:35.520
 I think you're like physically a different person.

00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:38.120
 - Yeah, and I think the point that like,

00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:41.240
 I wouldn't have had the career in my 30s

00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:43.800
 to like provide the ways that I did

00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:46.520
 if I hadn't had my 20s working very hard,

00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:49.520
 figuring out how to be good at a thing.

00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:51.280
 I guess it wasn't wasted, yeah.

00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:54.160
 - It's funny though, because when I say work a lot,

00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:56.160
 but then I think when I was all the time,

00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:59.160
 I'm like, just how much is going on in my life?

00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:01.800
 Like, the stuff I work on, like,

00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:04.000
 I think back to how we would do these like crazy,

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:07.400
 like many, many hour days, like falsely working,

00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:11.360
 wake up, pay the laptop, working in my, you know, early 20s.

00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:12.920
 But what the fuck?

00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:14.200
 I get more done now.

00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:18.120
 What was I, I put so many hours in and so much better now?

00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:19.360
 - Like, I was, I must have sucked.

00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:20.680
 I didn't feel like I sucked.

00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:21.520
 - Yeah.

00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:22.600
 - I felt like I was doing really good.

00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:26.520
 And if everyone around me seemed to confirm that.

00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:29.240
 And then like, everyone else seemed to be like,

00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:31.920
 I felt like above average compared to the stuff around me.

00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:32.760
 - Yeah.

00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:36.520
 - But like, clearly, I get way more stuff done.

00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:39.000
 I think it was, I was spending so much time, like,

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.000
 rewriting everything.

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.120
 I was like, it would be something.

00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:42.520
 It would suddenly arrive at the rewriting.

00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:44.840
 And like, now I never have to do that anymore.

00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:47.360
 - Well, well, I still have to do that.

00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:48.760
 - But not as much.

00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:49.840
 - Maybe not as much.

00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:53.040
 - I have similar feelings about the whole thing,

00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:56.840
 about like, feeling like I didn't think I didn't get much done.

00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:59.320
 Like, I felt like in my 20s, I was productive.

00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:01.720
 I felt like I was moving mountains.

00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:05.040
 But then I can like, remember stuff or I can see stuff.

00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:07.080
 'Cause I've had it started for 10 years now.

00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:08.640
 I can see stuff I wrote 10 years ago.

00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:09.480
 - Oh, you can.

00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:10.800
 Mine's all disappeared.

00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:11.640
 I can't look at it at all.

00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:13.760
 - There's some things, and some of it's just memory.

00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:15.280
 It's not like it's still in the code base.

00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:16.760
 But there's some things I've done at Sat News.

00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:18.680
 And I have like employees that are still at Sat News

00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:22.320
 that could tell you and vouch for just how awful my brain was

00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:23.160
 at times.

00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:24.480
 So I have that data point.

00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:27.320
 Like, I can look back at some of the stupidest stuff

00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:29.480
 that would make young developers feel very good

00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:30.480
 about themselves.

00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:32.280
 - Yeah, I mean, probably, I definitely have the same.

00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:36.480
 It was clearly like, I put so many hours in and I wasn't

00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:39.120
 getting like, I probably put in twice the number of hours

00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:39.960
 I put in now.

00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:41.160
 I was not doing twice a minute work.

00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:42.520
 I'm doing more work now than I was.

00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:43.520
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:44.680
 - Clearly, I was being stupid.

00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:47.400
 - Okay, I gotta share the dumbest of the dumb things.

00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:49.160
 And this is like gonna be so amazing.

00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:51.360
 - Is that bad?

00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:52.200
 - It's that bad.

00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:53.040
 - I deleted a database.

00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:54.200
 - I'm gonna like blush.

00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:55.320
 You deleted a database.

00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:57.440
 That's like a cool like, badge of honor.

00:55:57.440 --> 00:55:59.760
 This is like the most twisted shit.

00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:03.240
 Okay, I had this system.

00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:04.600
 This was in the status code base.

00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:08.080
 Like, this was an actual thing in the status code base.

00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:10.400
 It was like the name of the directories.

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:12.640
 (laughing)

00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:13.800
 - What are you laughing at?

00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:17.040
 - I just remembered another thing that's almost as dumb.

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:20.520
 Oh, we talked about this for the last seconds.

00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:22.640
 I was like, so it's fresh on my brain.

00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:26.520
 There was another one that was just too weird

00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:27.640
 to even talk about on the podcast.

00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:29.160
 But the one I'm talking about right now is like,

00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:33.280
 there was like logic, like conditions encoded

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:34.680
 in the names of the directories.

00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:35.520
 - Adam.

00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:37.040
 - Like nested directories, yeah.

00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:38.280
 - This is so funny.

00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:39.480
 Do you get why this is funny?

00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:40.320
 - Why?

00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:41.840
 - You're describing next year's.

00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:42.680
 - Oh my God.

00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:43.560
 (laughing)

00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:47.080
 - It is, I mean, it's like, yeah, it's the whole like weird,

00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:48.560
 it was like words.

00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:52.560
 I mean, it was like loops and stuff, like it's bizarre.

00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:53.560
 - Yeah, okay, you're right.

00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:56.520
 I definitely did stuff like very creative stuff like that.

00:56:56.520 --> 00:57:00.440
 - It felt very creative in the moment.

00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:03.960
 Yeah, they were like, win directories or something.

00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:05.440
 There was like, win, this happens.

00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:07.560
 Then this, I mean, it's like, each directory had a name

00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:09.280
 that like, made the thing make sense.

00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:10.280
 - That is so funny.

00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:11.120
 - It was bad.

00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:13.920
 - Well, hey, do you remember how you felt

00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:15.800
 in that moment when you made that?

00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:17.360
 Did you feel like you like,

00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:18.840
 was it like something you did without thinking

00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:20.080
 or did you feel proud of it?

00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:21.960
 'Cause I remember feeling very proud of stuff.

00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:23.520
 - Oh yeah, no, it was intentional.

00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:24.360
 - Okay.

00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:26.240
 - It was like, I'm innovating here.

00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:27.400
 Let me cook.

00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:29.080
 (laughing)

00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:30.240
 - Hang on, guys.

00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:31.520
 I got this before.

00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:33.560
 (laughing)

00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:36.040
 - And then you realize just how much like,

00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:39.920
 I mean, startups and like, the technical side of it,

00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:43.160
 the disconnect of that and the actual like, product success.

00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:45.000
 Like, so much of it was in spite of me,

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.600
 it was a terrible moment.

00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:49.640
 - The phrase in spite of, I think, is so important

00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:53.160
 because here, here's what happens.

00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:54.880
 Companies have the correct product.

00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:55.960
 They build the correct product.

00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:56.800
 - Yeah.

00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:57.800
 - And they get successful.

00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:00.240
 And then people that work there are such a list out

00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:02.480
 all the reasons why they were successful.

00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:05.200
 But I look at that stuff and I'm like, no.

00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:07.760
 In spite of all that dumbass shit you're listening

00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:09.320
 that you're proud of,

00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:12.360
 the product was so right that it worked anyway.

00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:13.200
 But that's what you get to do.

00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:14.880
 If you're successful, you get to claim

00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:18.480
 that any random thing you like was the reason it all worked.

00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:19.680
 - Yeah.

00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:21.480
 - I don't think I'm wasting my 30s at least.

00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:22.400
 - I don't think they're good.

00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:23.960
 But are we gonna say that in our 40s,

00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:26.160
 we're gonna be like, man, I wasted my 30s.

00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:28.840
 Remember that time I, I don't know.

00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:31.600
 - Through inventing New York and inviting 300 people?

00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:32.880
 - I know that horribly.

00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:35.120
 (laughing)

00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:37.720
 - Oh, oh man.

00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:38.560
 - Okay, well, we're on--

00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:39.400
 - It's been an hour.

00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:40.240
 - Yeah.

00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:41.720
 - I feel like we both just were like, huh.

00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:42.560
 (laughing)

00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:43.400
 - We did it, we did it.

00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:44.240
 - We did it, we did it.

00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:45.080
 - Okay.

00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:45.920
 - And we're going in here.

00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:46.760
 - All right, let's see everyone.

00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:48.120
 - Oh yeah, we don't have a way to do it.

00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:48.960
 - I'm good.

00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:50.280
 - I'm gonna look at the camera one more time.

00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:52.400
 (laughing)

00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:54.980
 (upbeat music)
