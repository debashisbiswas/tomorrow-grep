WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
 This time, we have nothing to talk about. We are literally recording a podcast about nothing.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.880
 I feel the fear creeping in in my stomach. It really is kind of scary.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.120
 What's going on with you? That time, we're going to Florida in a couple of weeks.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.040
 I don't think I told you this. Oh, really? Where are you?

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.240
 We're going to St. Pete. That's where Casey just went for that volleyball thing.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:49.520
 That's on the west side of Florida. It's Tampa. Yeah, it's like combined with Tampa.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.280
 It's like a suburb of Tampa. I don't know. It's just like St. Pete and Tamper all in once.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.920
 How long are you going for? After like six days in a couple of weeks.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.480
 I think we're leaving on the 19th. What are your plans?

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.440
 Like this podcast we don't have any. We have no plans. Just going to be on the beach.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.200
 Maybe me and Liz will stop by for a day or something. Oh, that'd be amazing.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.520
 Could you guys really? I don't know how far of a drive it is.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.560
 I mean, we don't mind long drives. We got because we used to do the New York to Florida drive.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.560
 So we've gone like our good habits for long drives and we can't look forward to it now.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.120
 I don't know how far that can't be too far. Let me let me look it up.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.520
 Yeah, I like long drives alone. Like I drove when we moved back from Naples,

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.720
 back to the Ozarks. They flew and I drove all our stuff.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.680
 And I love like just listening to it's like a reason to listen to like 20 hours of audiobooks.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:40.080
 But to be honest, like with people, not so not so big a fan. It's I don't know.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.600
 By people, do you mean children? Literally any other human beings in the car.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.200
 Anybody. I don't enjoy long drives.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.520
 So me and Liz also do the same thing where we listen to audiobooks and we got really

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.680
 into listening to like the best sci-fi short stories because the short story will be like two

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.840
 to three hours. Not a short story, like no, the novella or whatever, like the other forms.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.800
 It'll be like two to three hours. So it's perfect. So two or three hours, we can focus on one thing.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.640
 And you'll just like sit beside each other listening. You're each listening to the same book or

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.240
 different books. No, the same book. It's like going. Oh, okay. That makes far more sense. Yeah. Okay.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.160
 Why would you assume we're looking at different books like you're sitting next to each other

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.280
 with your own air pods and listening to different books? I don't know. I had all kinds of questions

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.760
 if that was the case. But no, no, no, no. We're listening to the same book and a lot of these

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.880
 sci-fi short stories are like really thrilling and engaging. Like they're short, so they resolve.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.560
 So it's not like this 20 hour thing. But yes, another really suspenseful and we get just really

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.560
 drawn into it and we'll just sit and listen and won't say anything for like two hours.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.360
 And then the end will be like, whoa, that was crazy. Is it like an audio black mirror kind of thing?

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.720
 Like that type of short story? Yeah, exactly, exactly. And there's like, there's like,

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:01.760
 so George RR Martin, who, who would do all the Game of Thrones stuff, he's got, I think,

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.880
 two really good novellas or novel, I forgot what they're called. I've literally never

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.360
 heard that word, by the way. I'm just those aren't going to weigh over here,

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.760
 when you say it, I'm like, I bet that's an actual word. Well, the way we go about this is we go to

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.320
 the Hugo Awards, which are like, you know, I think, I think it's sci-fi and fantasy awards,

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.600
 and then they have different categories and they have like novel, short story, novella, novelette.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.720
 I don't know what they mean, but you know, different lengths, I think. Yeah, so he's got one called

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:35.200
 Sand Kings, and it's like this horror slash sci-fi thing, and it's like a really slow build up.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.840
 And it's excellent. And that was the first one I listened to. And then since then, we've just been

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.040
 really into doing that. Yeah, I don't know about horror, but you had me up to that point. I think

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.080
 we could do like- It's not like horror, horror. It's just like, it's like a light horror. It's

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.840
 like suspenseful. You know, it's like building up to something. Soft core horror, if you will.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.840
 You can't listen to it with your kids in the car, for sure. Okay. Well, yeah, we will always

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.520
 have our kids in the car. That's the thing about kids. They always come with you everywhere you go.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.840
 And this is why we were talking about having AirPods and ignoring the other person. Yeah, exactly.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.520
 Having a good time in the front seat by myself. You guys are flying, I'm assuming.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.760
 We're flying. Yeah, yeah. It's our first time flying with our three-year-old. So

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.520
 Asa, our eight-year-old, we flew all over the place. It was when we started Stamp News. So we

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.480
 were like, he's been to like eight states. Like, before he was two, he had flown like a dozen times,

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.920
 and Archer has never been in a plane. So kind of terrified, like, that he's just going to freak

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.440
 out as we're taking off. Like, no, don't want to do this. If he knows what we're doing, like,

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.480
 I can't handle thinking about what you're doing in a plane. Like, the fact that you're so high up

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.360
 going so fast just freaks me out. If I think about it, I don't know if he'll really comprehend

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.960
 that that's what's happening. So I hope not. But yeah, first time in a plane with him.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.880
 So what were you saying before you said something about Casey?

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.960
 Oh, Casey just has this thing where you said, like, you'll go to the awards. She has this thing

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:02.160
 where she doesn't like things that people like. Like, if critics, if they get good reviews, any

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.400
 movie that gets good reviews, she just totally hates it immediately. Like, she doesn't want to

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.320
 watch stuff that's critically acclaimed or listen to stuff. And for the longest time, I tried to tell

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.040
 you, you've got to listen to serial. Have you ever listened to podcast serial? I hate that category

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.640
 of content. Oh, really? Well, there you go. Well, why do you hate it? Because I actually like it.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.280
 So now I feel like we have different tastes, but I thought we had similar tastes. Wait, so cereal

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.800
 is that thing about it's like one of those crime podcast. It's a crime. Yeah. Yeah. She's like,

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:36.080
 really good at storytelling, though. She just like, she's very engaging, except she did another one.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.280
 And then I didn't like it. The Bo Bird song one was like, I don't know, can't get into it.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.120
 But Sarah, I loved, like, love loved. Yeah, people got super in there. Everyone was talking about

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.200
 that. And there's been a bunch of us. Are you Casey? You don't like it? Because people got

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.160
 super into it. Is that what you're telling me right now? Well, you know, that is my persona,

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.880
 so I can relate to that. But that's that's actually not that's actually not the reason. I actually,

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:03.840
 I have my reason for it, but it's going to sound like a moral judgment of people that like it.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.480
 No, go ahead. Judge me. Judge me. It's not a judgment. It's just like, there's a part of me that

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:14.880
 when certain things are real and also entertainment, there's like a part of me that can't

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:21.360
 like stop thinking about that. And I kind of feel weird that I'm using this real thing that

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.560
 happens. This happens to this click for me a very long time ago. There was a day when I was like

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:32.240
 looking through some some app, whatever, to like figure out what to watch. And I remember I was

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.800
 watching something really stupid. And then I was like, looking for my next piece of entertainment.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.920
 And I was like, there's a bag when vice documentaries were like, kind of popular. Yeah, let me watch

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.760
 this. This looks fun. And it was about to my terrible situation. Because of course, all vice

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.880
 documentaries are about that. And in my head, I was just kind of like, this is so weird that I was

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.160
 just watching like something really stupid. And I'm just looking to be entertained. And now I pick

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.320
 this other thing about these people like suffering on the other side of the planet. It's kind of like,

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.200
 I think some people have this with meat where they realize like where meat comes from. Like,

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.640
 I think maybe you literally have to do this and they just can't eat it again. Yeah, it's kind of

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:09.200
 a similar thing for me with those like crime. Interesting. Okay. Things.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.960
 You're feeling a little, a little judged. Not too bad, though. I see where you're coming from.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:18.160
 The other side of it is people listen to this up and just get so freaked out.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.400
 Like this is a lot. She lives as friends listen to this stuff. And they just constantly talk about

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:29.680
 being murdered. Like, I never had that feeling. I didn't feel more endangered. But I loved it.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.920
 The serial podcast, I thought was so good. I finally got Casey to listen to it. And she loved it too.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.440
 So I feel like if you'd just give it a chance, no, I'm sure I would like it. I don't hear about

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:42.000
 the category, just the podcast serial. I need you to listen to that specific podcast and tell me

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.880
 if it's good or not. It probably is because everyone loves it. Like it's definitely good.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:50.160
 Exactly. I don't automatically hate stuff everyone likes, but it's okay. So going back to the original

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:55.840
 thing, I like the Hugo Awards because I don't think it's necessarily the typical like, oh, it's

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.920
 Oscar, it's like one in Oscar type of thing. It feels more like narrow. I feel like the people that,

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:04.400
 I don't even know what the process is or how they select winners. I feel like they typically pick

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.720
 stuff that I like. So for me, it's just a nice place to go to being like, okay, they've already

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:14.960
 checked all the things. Yeah. You found somebody that has your taste like a site that just resonates.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.640
 That makes sense. Yeah. Can we talk about how you and my wife are the same person and why am I

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:24.880
 drawn to people that are mean to me? That's all I'm thinking about right now is like you guys have

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:30.320
 so many similarities. And you both also are kind of mean to me. And I feel like I invite it.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:36.000
 Do I seek out punishment? What is going on? Well, list all the things that you find or the top

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.080
 things that you find similar. Well, then the one that sticks out is that you're mean to me.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.200
 Not mean to me, but just like you kind of pick on me and I'm thinking about the relationships

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:47.520
 I've had that are similar. But just now, I mean, in this conversation, like similarities with how

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:53.760
 you view media and how I don't know, I don't have a lot of them. Does that make this whole

00:08:53.760 --> 00:09:00.640
 conversation not as fun? Just like I'm noticing a vibe. It's a vibe that you guys have that are

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:06.880
 similar. The pick on you thing. Is that just me and Casey or is that everyone in your life?

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:11.680
 It's most of my close relationships. It's like I have to have somebody that picks on me.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:15.760
 Is it because I don't care? I really don't care when I get picked on. Some people maybe can't handle

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:20.000
 it. Is that it? I invite it because I can handle it. Well, this is my relationship with every

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.880
 anyone that I'm close with. So I like filter out anyone that doesn't like that type of relationship.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.920
 Okay. So you get something out of being able to like poke at people?

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:36.080
 It's just a way that I don't know. Okay. It's the thing I said the other day. It's the East Coast

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.920
 thing? No, it's intrusive. Well, that also, but it's also the intrusive thought thing where I feel

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:44.720
 like I'm always just having all these like really weird intrusive thoughts of like, that would be

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:49.120
 crazy if I said that out loud. And then what people I'm comfortable with, I can like do that to some

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:55.200
 degree. Yeah. And that's what feels fun about it. And it's also funny to me that I did say it out loud,

00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:00.640
 you know? Yeah. But that's where it comes from. And the other side, I think all wives pick on their

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:08.880
 husbands. Oh, okay. There's Liz that way with you. You're not picking on you? Oh, no. You literally

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:15.520
 had two data points to work with on this phone call. And it's 50%. You just said all she doesn't

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:21.040
 pick on you. Do you pick on her less than I do with everyone else? But yes, some degree. Wait,

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:25.840
 why do you pick on her less? Let's go let's pick at this. I'm going to this is therapy right now.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:30.160
 Does she have the power in your relationship? Do you feel like? Are you worried of?

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:38.640
 No, she has a lot of power in our relationship, for sure. But I think it's more that so this case,

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:44.160
 by the way, I mean, we all know that. Okay. Can I just have something? Okay, keep on.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:53.360
 You should ask her. Yeah. I think that there with your wife, there's like another dimension

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:59.280
 of romance. And I do think you can't just do the picking thing. Because I like, I think it's

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:03.600
 innately incompatible with the romance side. So it's like, needs to be a little bit more balanced.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:07.920
 Whereas I can just pick on you 100% of the time, because I'm not trying to be romantic with you.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:13.040
 That's true. Yeah. Okay. I don't think I'm romantic. I don't think I have that emotion. I don't have

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:18.640
 something about it. Can I say that? Do I sound like a jerk? Okay. But like, go back to the beginning.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.760
 I know this is a long time ago, because you guys met in high school, right? No, this story is just

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:26.800
 going to get worse. But go ahead. Okay. But I am curious, like, were you different than or like?

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:32.240
 No, I've never had I honestly, I always thought I would just never marry because I wasn't that like

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:38.640
 into relationships. I've had very few in my life. And even like, when Casey and I started dating,

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:44.400
 I was very into her. But I'm just, I feel like I'm not, I always said I'm not a romantic. My brother

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:50.640
 is super romantic. Like, he's like, just does all the things. And it's just like, amazing gestures

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:54.320
 to every girlfriend he's ever had. He's had 100. And that's not like a bad, that's not like a

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:59.440
 negative thing. Sorry. That's, that's not like a, like a slight. It's like, he's very, like,

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:05.360
 gets invested and has really great, like sparks with people. I've just never had any of that.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:09.200
 And that's where I feel like sometimes I'm a robot, right? Like, it's just my lack of emotional

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:13.920
 depth. Like I do nice things for Casey. But even when I do nice things, I don't feel like they're

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:19.360
 romantic. Does that make sense? Yeah. I mean, I'm not a big gestures person. I think that's like,

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:24.720
 that's like a common and I think obvious way to like express that. But I don't think that's

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:29.200
 me either. I definitely am. I would say I probably am a romantic person, but more that

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:35.040
 it just stems from me also being a dramatic person, I think. Like, I just like seeing everything

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:41.520
 in life in this like dramatized way. You know, like, when I think about my work and like, I'm

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:46.000
 working on a business and it's like, I have a very dramatic view of it. It's like,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.040
 we're doing this like crazy thing and there's all these people trying to stop us and like,

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:53.280
 we have enemies and we have friends and we have, you know, all these like crazy situations.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.800
 Like, I just view things in that way because I like, yeah, I don't know, just, just what

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:03.760
 natural would I do? And I think I express that also in our relationship and I can be like dramatic

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:08.720
 about it. Not in like a melodramatic way, just like, I like to be intense and kind of express it

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:13.840
 in like the most like movie like way possible. Yeah, yeah, I'm definitely dramatic. I'm learning

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:17.840
 that about myself. So I guess we're both we're both into that. I'm moving both stream on Twitch.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:24.400
 So there's that tell. I think, I think the word, I want to like reclaim the word dramatic because

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:28.000
 I feel like I've also recently discovered this is everything I just said about myself. I've also

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.520
 recently discovered it's only once me and Liz got together, she pointed this out and I was like,

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:37.760
 Oh, you know what? I never thought of myself as a dramatic person because I always thought

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:41.680
 like I roll dramatic, you know, whenever I thought, yeah, yeah, the word, the negative

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:47.280
 connotation to it for sure. Yeah, but she pointed out that, okay, it's not just that. It's also just

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:52.800
 like having a level of intensity about things. And I like that description of it and I like that

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:57.680
 part of it. So yeah, I think it's cool to be dramatic. I think we should talk about

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:04.080
 being like liking drama because we all do a lot of us do all do. I mean, especially like, that's

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:08.560
 the only reason I'm on Twitter for sure. I know. If there's not drama, it's just it's why why

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:15.920
 even get on there? Yeah, like like the fate. Seeing the drama is great. Then pretending to be like,

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:20.880
 Oh, you know, drama, like, you know, I hate when it's dramatic. Why can't we all get a lot like

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.040
 that whole thing we all get to do? And then what after we say that, then we just start to like go

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:30.960
 deeper into the drama. Yeah, yeah. That in itself is part of the drama. It's like being tired of

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:38.800
 the drama. Yeah, yeah. Do you get Peter Brown jelly sandwiches? Do you? There was stuff I

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:42.960
 had phases in my life where that was a big part of my life. So when you're younger, but not now,

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:48.000
 like you would say their child like weirdly, I didn't really have them when I was a child,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.280
 because I didn't like peanut butter, the child, because I felt like I made my mouth too dry.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:55.760
 Okay, that makes, I mean, I get it. Nobody really likes peanut butter in their mouth, but it's,

00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:00.160
 I love to do the peanut butter in the mouth and then have like a glass of something.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.640
 I'm going to say milk and you're going to make fun of me because everyone makes fun of me when

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:07.280
 I say I drink milk. No, I drink milk all the time. Okay, thank you. Why is everybody like

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:12.000
 adult men drinking milk? What? My wife makes fun of me every single time I have a glass of milk.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.080
 Oh, I don't understand it. This was early on, I think the first time we came to Miami with Liz,

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:20.960
 we went to like her favorite coffee shop and it's like this really like fancy like, not fancy,

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:25.440
 but it's a very like hip place. And I ordered a cup of milk and she was just like,

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:31.520
 Look at that's kind of funny to me. I don't know. It is funny. I just wouldn't do it in public,

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:36.000
 probably, because I know people are judging me. It's just, I just love milk. It's just like,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.400
 it's just like, it's just like washes stuff down. It's just that it's really good. And it can,

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:44.560
 milk and peanut butter, I actually would do a lot as well. Yeah. Yeah, I put peanut butter,

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:48.400
 like on my waffles, my pancakes, and then with milk, oh, it's so good.

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:52.560
 Yeah, it's great. I'll just, it's a great drink. I think back to the peanut butter and jelly thing.

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:56.640
 Yeah. You don't think that's a childish food, like to eat peanut butter and jelly is fine as an

00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:01.360
 adult. No, it's, I don't know. I'm just not the right person to ask. I like, we have this in common.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:06.800
 I think a lot of things I do maybe are childish. Okay. Me too. Okay. Yeah, I love kid foods like

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:10.480
 mac and cheese and peanut butter and jelly. Yeah, sometimes, I mean, I just mix it on. Why not?

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:15.280
 It's a, I mean, I see a lot of PB and J's when I was maybe a couple years ago. Yeah, PB and J.

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:20.080
 Sorry. I've been saying it like a buffoon, just spelling out the whole word, peanut butter and

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:26.640
 jelly. I got to say so much time, PB and J. When you make a PB and J, do you, do you spread the

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:30.640
 peanut butter on one piece of bread and then put the jelly on top of it? Or do you put the

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.360
 jelly on the other piece of bread and then put them together? No, I put on other piece of bread.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:36.800
 Do you mix it on the same slice? I put, yeah, I put the peanut butter on and then I just

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.600
 pour some jelly on top and I kind of move it around with the other piece of bread. Does that make

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.440
 sense like spread it around? Okay, first, I was going to say that's ridiculous, but now that I'm

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:48.320
 imagining it's actually better. It just depends on like, if it's jelly or jam because jam, you have

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:52.960
 to spread because it's thicker. Wait, what jelly and jam are the same thing? You're talking about

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:58.080
 something you pour out of a jar. Yeah. But can you imagine me thicker that you can't pour out of a jar?

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:03.120
 Have you ever had something that isn't as viscous? Yeah, not as viscous. Wait, which one's which

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.920
 then? So which one is the one you can't pour? I think I know what you're talking about. I think

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:09.520
 jam is thicker and I think I prefer jam. You have to take a knife to it and it clumps. It's like

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:14.560
 chunks of it. Come out. Well, I don't know about chunks. I'm imagining smooth, but like jello,

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:21.840
 like jello. No, it's like jello. The other one is like jello consistency. I don't, I don't know.

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:27.200
 I'm just saying there's, there's some. Okay, so what kind of, what's your, is like a brand

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:32.480
 you go to as a local? Is it like, it's in our health food store. So it's like, what's it called?

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:38.160
 Crofters? Crofters. It's like, yeah, it's not, it doesn't have any weird stuff in it. I don't know.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:43.920
 That's nice. Yeah, you know, we like to keep all the, the weird stuff out of our bodies,

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:46.800
 but I can pour it. You can pour it. Yeah, no, I know what you're talking about. It's just the,

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:51.600
 the usually the thing I, the jam that I get, jam jelly, whatever is, I can't pour it. So I

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:56.240
 split it on the other side and I, okay, pop it together. But then do you have to use like two knives?

00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.240
 No, I wash, I wash, I do the jelly first, and then I, it's like, it's like a quick wash,

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.920
 because the jelly comes off and then, you know, butter. Okay. Yeah. Oh, jelly first,

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:08.240
 interesting. Sorry. I'll stop. We stopped talking about PB&J.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:14.880
 Well, we always talked about talking about your relationship with food and like how you guys do

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:19.600
 food. Do you want to talk about that? Oh, did we talk already about how you're wrong when you do

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:23.360
 keto? Did we already have that conversation? No. Or is that all? We've never done it.

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:28.160
 We've never done it. And we've talked about how you're, you're, you're going to lose if you don't

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:33.600
 have your wife with you. So that's true. I don't. Yeah. I literally don't have any opinions. I just,

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:38.000
 I regurgitate everything I hear from my wife. And then I usually mess up a fact and the whole case

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.880
 gets mad at you because you represented it wrong. Yeah. Yeah. So we can't have that conversation,

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:48.080
 but we can talk about food. I'm doing a thing now. I'm, it's Adam Waffen tweeted about it. It's

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:54.640
 called my body tutor. It's like us, the food psychology kind of thing. I can eat a ton and not

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:59.280
 put on weight, just like my genetics, my grandpa was just like, he was always thin. I think like,

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:03.520
 I'm internally putting on weight or something like on my organs. I just know it's not good for

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:08.560
 me when I just eat the way I want to eat. I have this weird thing with food. I just feel like most

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:12.480
 of the reasons I eat are not because I'm hungry. It's like my kids left food and I don't want to

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:16.640
 throw it away. Why don't I want to throw it away? I should throw it away. So I'm doing this thing.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:20.000
 And I have to tell them what I eat every day. And they like give me all these encouraging messages.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.880
 It's nice encouraging messages like, well, what if you, what if you did bad? What if you ate too much?

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:28.240
 So far, I haven't done bad. Because the thing is when you have to take pictures of everything you

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:32.720
 eat and send them to somebody, you think about what you eat. That's it. Yeah. Yeah.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.840
 Eventually, they'll probably wear off. It'll make two weeks in. If it wears off,

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:40.560
 then you can sign up from my program where I'd berate you every time you would.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:45.680
 So I just send you pictures. I just text you every single thing I eat and you'll just make fun of me.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:49.920
 Yeah. That'd be free. We could just do that for free. You can't stop me from texting.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:54.080
 I would pay you to do that. Oh, really? For me to be able to do that.

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.960
 Sort of content or something? Are you going to put it on the internet or something?

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:00.960
 No, just for personal enjoyment. Just to be able to roast you in another way.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:07.120
 Such a sadist. My wife is a sadist. I swear, just get so much out of poking me.

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:12.000
 I feel like you're the same. Wait, isn't sadist when you enjoy not to masochist?

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.360
 Other people's pain is other people's pain. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I do love that. I love other

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:21.040
 people's pain. I do. I do. I do love that. Yeah. The thing with eating, this is funny.

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:26.880
 This came up with us too recently. My family also is kind of very naturally skinny.

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:34.960
 And I will easily forget to eat. I'll easily forget to. I think I'm more likely to under eat

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:39.520
 than overeat. And I've been as fast as I was a kid because I would get really bored of eating.

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:44.800
 Like I would be halfway into a meal. I would just get really bored of the physical, active eating.

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:51.600
 Sometimes I actually find certain foods tiring to eat. Like if I'm going to eat a sandwich and

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:56.320
 it's kind of falling apart, that's going to result in me not eating the whole sandwich.

00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:00.320
 So sometimes I'm just saying. I know what you're saying there. Yeah. I don't like when my food is

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:04.720
 hard to eat. Like when it's either the sandwich is so big, you can't even get your mouth around it

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:08.320
 and you're squeezing stuff out. I hate that. Yeah. Like I'd rather just eat it in a bowl.

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:15.360
 Just like give me a bowl. Exactly. My favorite food is soup. And I think I just like the various

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:19.920
 soups that are out there. And I think it's because of this reason. I could eat soup forever and never

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:24.400
 be full though. That's a problem for me. Yeah. No, like I could literally sit there at the table

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:28.240
 and you could just keep serving me soup. And I feel like I'd never get full. I'm pretty big though.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:35.440
 Yeah. I'm a large adult man. I'm not so big. You're not small. I'm like exactly average for

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:41.040
 America. Height. Maybe not weight. I'm happy to be an exactly average American. It's the only

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:51.600
 place where I'm average in every possible way. So Liz was talking to my mom. And my mom has

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.960
 had this thing her whole life because she's always been really skinny. And she's actually,

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:57.840
 this is just going to annoy everyone. And this is the concept. This is the

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:04.160
 concept. She's been really skinny. And she's always had to work hard to get to a weight that

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:10.000
 she wants to be. Like gain weight, right? Up. Yeah, she has to go up. And she was complaining to Liz

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.800
 being like, you know, all my friends that always make fun of me being like, you're so skinny and

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:18.400
 I have to sit there and take it because I can't be like, well, you're really fat, you know?

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:23.920
 Can't go the other way. Yeah, just complain about how like it's like, it's just as hard for me,

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:28.080
 you know, like she's like, it's hard for me also. Like, it's not, it's not easy. And then

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.840
 those are just like, none of this matters. Like you just literally can never say anything. Like,

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:36.080
 it's just, I know it's unfair, but that just, this is the way way things are. I thought about it,

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:40.080
 even while you were saying it, like, forget to eat, how tough that's, that's difficult. Yeah,

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:47.120
 people hate it for you. I feel bad for you. Yeah. I definitely seen myself as I've gotten a little

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:53.120
 bit older. I definitely have gained more weight. Still like weight, like none is not a problem at all,

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:57.360
 but yeah, it happens even for people that are naturally skinny. Like you just get to a certain

00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:01.360
 age and you're retaining weight a little bit more. Yeah, I put it in my face, which sucks,

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:05.520
 because it's the first thing anybody sees. Like I carry weight in my face. I swear that's the first

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:10.960
 place it goes. It's really annoying. I mean, that's very common. And also, oh, really? Yeah, and also

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:15.280
 you're on most people you know are on Twitch. So the only thing we see is your face. Yeah, exactly.

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:18.240
 Most people on the internet will only ever see my face. And they're like, that guy.

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:21.040
 Unless you start posting on other sites, on some other specific sites.

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:25.280
 What are you implying? I can't make these jokes with you, because I feel like you just don't know

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:29.440
 anything about anything. I know I've heard enough of the only fan stuff. I'll definitely get that

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:34.560
 joke. That's funny. I definitely didn't know. I think Twitch taught me what it was. I'm pretty sure.

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:39.520
 Well, I live in the OnlyFans capital. Oh, Miami. Yeah, that would be, that would be a big. Yeah,

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:44.080
 I mean, just like, it's like LA and that like everything's very like appearance driven, right?

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:49.840
 Miami is that way? Yeah, well, we have, we have this concept here called OnlyFans Towers.

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:55.120
 And there's like this category of like brand new luxury, like luxury-ish buildings that have

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:58.480
 popped up. And people call them OnlyFans Towers, because everyone that lives in them

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:04.320
 makes their money from OnlyFans. Really? How does everyone know? It's a joke, but it's also kind,

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:10.320
 it's also kind of real. You can just kind of tower like, there's like a vibe and aesthetic to it.

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:14.960
 Interesting. Yeah, I would like you just to describe that aesthetic for me, please.

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.320
 No, I'm going to get in trouble if I do that.

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:17.120
 Okay, sure, okay.

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:20.400
 Or not. You can go to OnlyFans.com and then you can do your own research.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:20.880
 Okay, yeah.

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:29.120
 So how's it going with your house construction stuff? What's like the current projects?

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:34.080
 You know, we're getting close to being like settled. I feel like two years in. We are going to do like

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:38.720
 the backyard. So the back right now is just like, there's so much mulch because we were going to

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:42.320
 plan a bunch of stuff and then we didn't plan a bunch of stuff. Well, we plan a bunch of stuff

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:46.400
 in the front, not in the back. This is so boring. This is so like suburban America.

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.960
 Like, why would you ask me this question?

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:53.280
 This is the point. Okay. For people, our, if our audience is people in our age range,

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.280
 this is like the most fascinating thing on the planet.

00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:00.160
 Okay, that's true. So we're going to do like an in-ground hot tub. We thought we'd do a pool,

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:04.480
 but we have a pool in our neighborhood and we think we're just going to do a hot tub.

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:09.200
 All we really care is to have a hot tub. Yeah. Our sauna comes. It's shipped. It'll be here in a

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:13.680
 couple of weeks. Nice. We're going to like stain our back deck because it has like a bunch of clay

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:17.680
 stains because Missouri is just like all clay. So we're going to stain it and then put the sauna

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:22.080
 in and do a hot tub, do some like terraces and a fire pit. We're just going to make the back like

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:26.560
 as nice as the rest of it. The front is nice. We've done a lot landscaping and everything else.

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:30.400
 I haven't done much in the back. So that's kind of the next project. I don't know.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:36.480
 So I had a hot tub growing up, but it annoyingly ours was close in the winter. Are yours going to

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:40.480
 be like a year round hot tub? Oh, really? Oh, we want a year round. That's the best time. It's like

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:43.760
 snowing out. I was just attached to our pool. So when they close the pool, there's a kind of cover

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:47.760
 of the hot tub also. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're going to have a year round. That's the goal. Yeah,

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:52.160
 I think that they can do that. They just said the equipment has to be in a like heated space.

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:55.680
 So I don't know how we're going to do that. I might lose some of my office closet, actually.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:26:00.960
 They might have to put it in there. It kind of sucks. Is a sauna something you've done before?

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:05.040
 Is this something you're trying to get into? Yeah, every time I travel. Okay. So this is,

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:11.040
 I've told this story before and everyone like made fun of me. I just, I'm not very relatable,

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:16.160
 I guess. Anyway, whenever I travel, my co-founder and I will always find like if we're whatever city

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:20.400
 we're in, we'll go to an equinox because he's like an equinox member or whatever. I guess you

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:23.760
 have to be a member. I don't know. I've never had to pay to go to an equinox. I don't know what the

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:28.400
 rules are. I think it's expensive and that's why people made fun of me. I mean, I was, we had

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:32.000
 equinox when we were in New York and it was convenient because when we would visit to visit Miami,

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.200
 we could just go. Yeah. So it is nice if you're like a traveling person. Yeah. So like every city

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:44.000
 we're in, we find an equinox and we do the steam room. It's so hot. Like it burns inside your

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.280
 nostrils. Like you can't feel anything but pain. And you're in there for like 10 minutes and then

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:53.920
 you get in a cold shower and you just do that back to back. You just like rinse repeat four or five

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:57.760
 times. It's the best I've ever felt in my life. Like every time I get out of that, I'm like,

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:01.840
 I need to own a sauna. So we've, we've actually waited like six months for this sauna. Yeah. It

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:06.800
 was like we ordered it and we've been waiting. So it's coming. So in New York, I live in New York,

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:10.640
 the building I lived in, we actually had a steam room and a sauna. Actually, we had both in the,

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:14.480
 I guess they're different things. Yeah. Yeah. So I've, oh, I've, I've done the steam room a bunch.

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:17.600
 Actually me and Alan used to do the steam room together a bunch and we was getting there and we

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:22.880
 sweat and he was. Yeah. He, he's a big steam room person, a steam room slash sauna person.

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:26.960
 I would just start dying like very quickly. I got to get out of here. I can't breathe.

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:32.400
 But I've never done the sauna. So have you done both? I guess no, I guess I always do steam rooms.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:35.360
 So I don't even know what the sound is going to feel like. I just know it's hot.

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:39.360
 Yeah. I think it's pretty different because it's all dry. Right. Oh, interesting. I think

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:44.960
 saunas are supposed to be better. I'm assuming they say it's good for your health. I don't

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:48.080
 understand how it's good because we got an infrared one, which I wanted to get like a

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:52.080
 traditional one just because it's, I don't know, the infrared thing weirded me out.

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:57.280
 But everybody says, the sort of laser onto you and it like heats you up from the inside like

00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:01.760
 a microwave. I don't understand how that's healthy. How do they know? Have they actually

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:06.160
 studied anybody long enough to know that that's good for you? Because to me, heating up my insides

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:09.760
 sounds like a terrible thing to do. It just sounds like cancer. Wait, does it actually heat up your

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:14.000
 insides or heat up your skin? No, it actually heats you up from the inside out. That's what I've heard.

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:18.080
 And that's supposed to be the reason it's good, which doesn't make any sense to me.

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.960
 That's really crazy. Yeah, I feel like there's not been enough studies done.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:25.600
 I'm going to die of like liver cancer or something because I heat it up my liver to me.

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:28.960
 Yeah. All your healthy eating. All your healthy eating is going to be countered by

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:31.360
 nothing later on yourself. Yeah, exactly.

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:36.640
 That does seem a little weird. The other thing that's really cool and I think you maybe are the

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:41.280
 person to get this because I feel like you have this space and you will just go above and beyond.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.040
 Have you seen those things that like frees you? I'm sure you have because you just kind of

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:52.640
 sports people. Do it. So I haven't seen a thing. I know like Wim Hof, the Iceman, like getting

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:56.640
 ice baths every day. And it's supposed to be so good for you. I don't know. I want to have like

00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:00.640
 a plunge away. We can like submerge ourselves in ice water. The thing I'm talking about though,

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:06.240
 it's like maybe I'm remembering is wrong, but actually the gym in like my parents town actually

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:11.280
 has one. It's like you step into this thing and it's almost like a mold of like a person and you

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:17.200
 like get in the mold and they like close it on you. And then it just like hyper like freezes your,

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:21.440
 I think I think they use like nitrogen or stuff. I've got what it is, but they like instantly

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:25.760
 make you crazy cold for a short amount of time and then you get out of it and supposed to be

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:30.720
 really great for inflammation and stuff. I think a bunch of like pro athletes do that now.

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:34.640
 Oh, yeah. So I've heard of this and the cryotherapy. That's what it is. Yeah, the cryotherapy and

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:39.200
 they've got like hyperbolic chambers and all this stuff. Yeah, it turns out that just like existing

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:44.000
 in our normal atmosphere is terrible for you. You need to either be heated from the inside

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:50.240
 or frozen, but this temperature, not good. It's like this is what decays us. It's so weird.

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:55.120
 Yeah. Well, I felt that way about when I lived in New York, I just felt like my genetics were not

00:29:55.120 --> 00:30:02.320
 suited for the climate and I would feel like my bones hurt. And then my friend who he's from Chicago,

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:07.120
 but like historic, like his family is from like Scandinavia. He just never had a problem with the

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:12.880
 cold ever. And I was like, I think there's nothing to your genetics. They just adapt. Yeah. Yeah.

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:18.480
 People up north, like in Wisconsin, even Northern Michigan, like those people, it's like they come

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:23.120
 to the Ozarks. I mean, I know people that it's like they're in shorts. It's the middle of the

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:26.400
 winter. It's like no big deal to them. I don't understand how that's possible, how your body can

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:32.400
 adapt to that cold. Cold just hurts. It just hurts. I really have to pee. Like I'm bouncing.

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:37.120
 Oh, so I, I'm, this can not be on the podcast, Chris. I'm sorry. It can be. I'm just saying it

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:43.360
 could be cut out if you want, but I had caffeine this morning. It, listen this, this, uh, it's like

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:49.440
 a protein shake in a bottle, but it's a coffee flavored blend. And it's like, you're supposed to

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:53.120
 drink the whole thing. It's one serving. And I had it while I was working out. And I knew it had

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:58.960
 caffeine and I didn't know how much 168 grams of, or milligrams of caffeine. That's a, that's a ton,

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:02.000
 right? I don't know. I don't know how much that is. I make cups of coffee. That's a lot. It's like two

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.080
 cups of coffee. They put two cups of coffee in a protein shake. I don't understand why. They had

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:10.080
 to go out of their way to give me that much caffeine. Well, it's a workout shake then, right? Isn't that

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:14.880
 what the workout ones are? They're like just Jack over caffeine? Yeah, I guess. How did your workout?

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:18.960
 Was it good? It was good. Did you hear me say that I really have to pee? Like I'm, I'm hurting. You

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:23.040
 should go pee. And I feel like you're just trying to keep me. Yeah. I gotta go. Like I gotta go. I'll be

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:53.040
 - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:55.680
 Yeah, no, you're great, Adam. That's definitely what's going on.

00:31:55.680 --> 00:32:00.640
 Don't do that. You got to put it right back. I just took it right back.

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:04.080
 Okay, I'm really going to end it.
