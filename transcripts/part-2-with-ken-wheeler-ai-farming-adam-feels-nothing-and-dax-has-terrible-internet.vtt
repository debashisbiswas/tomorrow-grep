WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
 - It's not 'cause you joined Ken, I didn't want it recorded.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.260
 - Oh no, it's cool, let's see how that goes.

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:06.600
 (laughing)

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.180
 (upbeat music)

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.140
 - I should, that was wrong, my internet,

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.640
 'cause I just moved and I didn't notice

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.500
 but the internet guys swapped out my modem.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.940
 You like just swapped it for no reason, which was fine,

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.520
 but then it turns out there's four ports on the back

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.980
 and only one of them technically work.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.100
 So like, why would the fuck am I supposed to know that?

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.940
 Do you remember a bit?

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.860
 Yeah, we used to live in a time

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.700
 where all the ports used to work, but now, you know.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.580
 - Why don't the ports work?

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.100
 - It's weird, it's like I tried each one

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.100
 and I got flaky like service, but then one worked.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.280
 And the one that worked is like mapped

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.280
 a little bit differently.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.920
 - Modems and internet are fucking bullshit,

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.760
 to be honest with you.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.860
 Like, I like go talk to the like Verizon, right?

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.820
 And I'm like, that was like, I did my shit.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.820
 And I'm like, oh well, you know,

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.700
 I had problems with the other company.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.700
 I'm like, can you guarantee that this will be fast, right?

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.860
 And they're like, yeah, right?

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.740
 So then it's slow.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.460
 So I call them up, I'm like, what the fuck?

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.980
 And they were like, oh well, you know,

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.720
 doesn't count for Wi-Fi connections.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.460
 (laughing)

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.660
 And then I'm like, okay, but I'm like,

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.380
 it's like, like one of them's hardwired

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.220
 and it's still fucking slow.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.980
 And they're like, oh well, we'll schedule something.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.140
 So I'm gonna take a look at it.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.420
 Long story short, I got so pissed off

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.300
 and I ended up getting business internet.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.580
 I literally have business internet in my house right now.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.060
 And it's still fucking suck.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.060
 But it's like, if it's gonna suck,

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.940
 I can like get like a statement credit or something.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.140
 So I feel like there's incentive on them

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.460
 to make it not suck, right?

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.540
 They have like an uptime fucking incentive.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.620
 - Yeah, SLAs on your home internet.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.340
 - But it's also a pain in the ass because like I can't,

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.860
 like I have it bundled so I can't use like the FiOS TV app.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.300
 I have to use like the Verizon behind this app

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.820
 and that doesn't like my dog, like chew my controller.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.180
 - You know, say I have no remotes.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.260
 I've got no remotes at all.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.740
 - Like that digital remote doesn't work.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:32.580
 - Yeah.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.420
 - It doesn't work.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.380
 - No, it doesn't work with the business internet.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.660
 What a time to be alive.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.660
 - It's wild because these companies run the internet.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.380
 Like the most, one of the most important things in the world.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.460
 And I was going to their site yesterday

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.540
 to like change my plan.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.740
 And I kid you not.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.580
 It's like every page is like a minute of spinners

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.060
 and bouncing between like random ass sub domains.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.060
 And I'm like, how did this company run like K internet

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.220
 to like every single house in America?

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.260
 But then like this bullshit.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.420
 They should use RSPs.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.820
 I'm just kidding.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.940
 - They're using JSP is what they're using.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.180
 - Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.860
 This is so slow.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.020
 Like I just, it's painful and I can't believe

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.100
 this is the same company.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.580
 - I feel like a lot of that is like back end

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.140
 refusing to cooperate, right?

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.660
 Like the front guys are like, hey, let me, you know,

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.820
 let me get what I need to build this website.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.020
 Like here's a general purpose API fucking run a proxy

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.980
 through it and take out what you need.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.940
 You're like, oh, okay, thanks.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.620
 - It's like you can see the whole history

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.740
 of all their technical debt through like all the redirects.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.900
 It like starts to load one front end

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.980
 and realizes like you're in a specific part of the thing

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.500
 that like flips to a different front end

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.860
 and then like that has a spinner

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.740
 and then like hits some other back end

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.580
 that sends you back.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.700
 It's fucking insane.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.140
 - Have you guys ever worked on shit like that?

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.980
 - Yeah.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.140
 Like like what's the classification here?

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.900
 - Of like large.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:09.800
 - Old shit, yeah.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.900
 - Old shit.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.580
 - Yeah, not like a website,

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.020
 but I've worked on some old stuff in finance.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.420
 - I've worked on some large old shit way back in the day.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.100
 - Yeah, and everything was like still Java and shit

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.260
 and it was like, it was devastating.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.540
 - Yeah, I've got, we had all kinds of weird stuff.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.020
 It was like the original engineer created a zone

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.260
 kind of like serialization approach and it was like,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.700
 instead of JSON, it was just like piped limited values

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.900
 in a big string.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:38.900
 I can't remember what they were called.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.340
 There was a name for them.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.260
 And they were just like the bane of everyone's existence

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.060
 'cause there'd be these weird situations

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.180
 where something didn't serialize well.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.620
 It's because this stupid format

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.140
 was supposed to be like really terse and fast.

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.020
 - Wasn't this literally like,

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.860
 was it prime?

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.620
 Like, wasn't there some joke about this exact concept?

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.420
 Like some guy invented something,

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.580
 but like you actually lived it?

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.900
 - Oh, I hadn't heard the prime joke.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.580
 I mean, I get like JSON has its downsides,

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.380
 but like trying to work with somebody's proprietary,

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.500
 I don't know, mangled up string was a nightmare.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.700
 - You saw this pretty fucking awesome, in my opinion.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.620
 - Yeah, I mean, the stuff we work on it doesn't matter.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.060
 I guess like if you're like doing high frequency trading

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.340
 or something, then I can't comment on that not so much.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.100
 - Yeah, I mean, it works and it's readable.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.580
 I have no complaints really.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.860
 And it's a, I know it's like technically a performance thing,

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.980
 but like that should have still so fast now

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.860
 'cause everything, every parser is like crazy optimized

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:34.700
 for in every language.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.500
 - There's like fast for like normal people.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.020
 Like if you work at the level that I work at,

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.940
 which is like websites and like stuff that users use,

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.060
 then like what is fast?

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.060
 But if you're, I guess if you're doing like systems level

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.460
 stuff, then you're like, man, JSON parsing is so slow.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:52.860
 And that's, I guess where prime lives.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.060
 - I mean, JSON parsing is fucking slow, generally speaking.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.900
 - Right?

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.660
 Like I had like some JSON stringify in a hot path

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.380
 that was getting like way too big of a JSON object

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.500
 that it was like noticeably slow, even for websites.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.740
 So I could see like I was looking into like DevOps shit

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.740
 and then I'm looking into like just like logging shit

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.180
 like aggregation and like sorting in real time

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.020
 and shit like that.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.900
 And I'm like, you know, I get why they need that kind of speed

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.900
 or special formats for that kind of thing.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.660
 Like if you're gonna like have like real time analytics

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.100
 or something or searching on it, like like how the fuck

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.740
 do you search like millions of records that fast?

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:34.580
 No, not with JSON?

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.740
 - I thought you're tweeting about DevOps

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.140
 called to some DevOps nerds to help you.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.980
 - Yeah.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:42.820
 - And then we got on a call.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.220
 - And me and Dax are kind of DevOps nerds.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.900
 - Are you guys kind of, I hate the word DevOps.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:47.740
 I don't know.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.060
 - I don't think it just means nothing to me.

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.300
 (laughing)

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:58.260
 - I literally figure out how to deploy all these shitty

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:59.660
 as front end frameworks.

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.500
 That's basically what I do.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.900
 - Yeah, but you like write the code to do that though, right?

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:08.140
 That's like your thing, like you're building a platform.

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:09.940
 - Well, it's more like I figure out

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.380
 given what infrastructure we have, AWS Cloudflare, et cetera,

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.860
 how do we like use them effectively to do various things

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.220
 for people that don't know about those things?

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:21.900
 - Pipe it into Gigapanther.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.100
 (laughing)

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.100
 - That show is funny.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.020
 (laughing)

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.220
 - It's so funny because like, you know,

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.620
 like I get like make fun of that,

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.660
 but like front end has the exact same shit.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.300
 - Yeah, it's true.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.020
 - I feel like whatever happened in DevOps

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.580
 is like the exact same thing that happened in front end.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.300
 Everybody just dorked out a little too hard

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.900
 and now there's like all these like fucking

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.500
 bespoke, bullshit-y, crazily named things.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.380
 - Yeah, there's like a million layers between everything.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.020
 That's just what always happens in every industry.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.540
 I feel like everything that I worked in started off simple

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.060
 and now just has like a hundred steps in between.

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:54.980
 - I was thinking about this morning,

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.540
 how I don't actually understand like bundlers.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:01.060
 Like I know that Astro uses VIT and roll up

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.700
 and I don't know which one I'm done with.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:03.620
 - That's a great one.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:04.900
 That's actually a great example.

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.700
 - Like I have no idea what each of them does.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:09.180
 Astro is a framework, but they don't,

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.620
 they're built on top of VIT,

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.140
 which is kind of another framework.

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:13.820
 It doesn't actually do any of the bundling.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.060
 It uses ES build, but only in Dev,

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:17.380
 but then when you're in production,

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:18.460
 then it uses roll up.

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:20.020
 - Oh my God, I hate it so much.

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:20.860
 - Yeah.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:21.700
 - And now they're going up.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:22.540
 - What is going up?

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:23.620
 - Both of those are the new thing called roll down.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:24.460
 It's just like--

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:27.020
 - I saw, but do you know what they actually do?

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:27.860
 - What?

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:28.700
 - In terms of what?

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:29.540
 - Oh, it's fucking gross.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:30.460
 - Bundlers do?

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:31.300
 - Yeah.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.940
 - I mean, kind of like I know they end up like

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.300
 taking all my stuff and putting it on the website,

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:36.740
 like turning it into--

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.260
 - Do you know what an iffy is?

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.100
 - A what?

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.180
 - Yeah, immediately executing function or whatever.

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:44.580
 - Oh, like where it's wrapped in print and you like execute it?

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:45.420
 - Yeah.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:46.260
 - Yeah.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:47.100
 - Yeah, that thing, yeah.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.740
 So that's what a bundler does.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.700
 - It builds up like a dependency graph, right?

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.620
 And then it'll go and kind of like resolve that into,

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.900
 like the webpack output is just a bunch of iffy's

00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.260
 with like DEP injection.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.620
 If you ever roll your own DEP injection,

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:03.860
 like if you have to do some weird ass like a valuable shit,

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:06.940
 you're like, "Oh, okay, that's what's going on here."

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:08.700
 - I'm sure DEX is done stuff like that.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:09.540
 - You seem smart, DEX.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.500
 - If you look, yeah, 'cause we use E as build like a ton,

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.300
 which is, E as build's amazing, I love it.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.980
 I think a lot of the work that we do would not be possible

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.980
 if not for E as build and how fast it is.

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:22.620
 But if you look at the output of it,

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.020
 which we do a lot 'cause of debugging,

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:26.940
 it's really crazy some of the stuff that does.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:30.060
 There's like so many little micro optimizations you can do

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.060
 when you're like, when you have a hundred files

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:34.420
 and you need to pack them into a single file.

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.300
 But a lot of times those optimizations don't work.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:41.300
 So if in your hundred files, you're importing the same module,

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:44.580
 it should be smart enough to like lift that up to the top

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:48.060
 and like import it once and then like, you know,

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:49.500
 everything in reference to a variable.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.380
 But sometimes it can't figure that out

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:54.020
 'cause JavaScript is weird and you end up with like,

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:56.500
 let's say you're importing AWS SDK, you get like,

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.860
 hey, it's a SK1, AWS SK2, AWS SK3,

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.460
 and they'll be like nine definitions of the same variable.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:04.940
 It's yeah, it's wild, but it does do some cool optimizations.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.500
 - I literally had this issue yesterday, Dax,

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:10.500
 where I had two different SDK, like V3 packages.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:14.580
 So it was like translate and bedrock or something.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.060
 And they were different versions

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:18.380
 that rely on a different sub package,

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.340
 like a little util package.

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:21.460
 And there was a different version.

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:23.700
 So then at runtime, it was trying to use two different,

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:24.700
 it blew up.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.740
 It was just so annoying to like have to Google that stuff

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.740
 and figure out what's going on.

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:30.700
 - Do you guys think tree shaking will ever work?

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:34.980
 - We rely on a lot, like we bundle our stuff in a way

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.340
 that's meant to be tree shaking,

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:38.900
 but it takes a lot of effort from us

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:42.820
 to not accidentally introduce something that stops it.

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:46.340
 But we use ES build, which isn't like the best tree shaker

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:47.180
 in the world.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.220
 So I assume that when people are using roll up and stuff,

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:51.540
 it's maybe better.

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:52.660
 - Shakin' farther.

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.420
 - Oh, it can always get shakin' farther.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:56.000
 - Yeah, further.

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:02.000
 - I like the coconut trees and that's his backyard.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.180
 - You have coconut trees?

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.020
 - No, I don't actually, but I want them.

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:05.980
 Okay, here's a-

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:06.980
 - Wait, wait, wait, you moved.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:08.700
 Do you still have, you're not a mangoes anymore?

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:09.780
 - So I moved next door.

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:10.620
 - So you still have mangoes?

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:12.100
 - So I moved one house over.

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.300
 No, so we don't have any fruit trees

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:15.420
 or anything in this new house,

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:16.620
 but we're gonna plant some.

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:17.860
 And I think the first thing we're gonna plant

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:19.180
 is a mango tree.

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.100
 And they take like two or three years.

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:23.420
 Did you hit a certain age

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.980
 and use fucking love trees and just what happened?

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.100
 - Specifically fruit trees.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:31.660
 - So have you looked at fastgrowingtrees.com?

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:34.380
 - Yes, I've ordered thousands of dollars worth of trees

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:35.700
 from fastgrowingtrees.com.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.180
 - And how did it go?

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:38.900
 - You know, most of them are doing okay.

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:40.420
 Cherry trees for some reason.

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:42.620
 The deer just loved cherry trees in the Ozarks,

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:43.540
 and they've like-

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:44.380
 - You said so?

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:45.220
 - Both of them did it.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.540
 Yeah, they just literally stomped them to the ground.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:48.380
 - I don't know.

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:49.820
 - I can say with you for a week.

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:50.660
 - I don't know what-

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:53.020
 (laughing)

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:56.060
 - But like, I've got three apple trees

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:56.900
 that are all doing pretty good.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.940
 I got an apple last year, first apple.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:11:59.780
 - First year?

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:00.620
 - They grow pretty fast.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:01.980
 No, it was the second year we've had them.

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:03.700
 - Second year we've got one apple.

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.420
 - Yeah, out of three trees.

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:07.260
 - What zone are you in?

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:08.180
 - I have no idea.

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:10.020
 I knew at the time, I think six.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:11.020
 I knew when I was ordering them

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.500
 'cause it has the charts.

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:13.340
 Six or seven?

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:14.580
 - I think I'm in seven.

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:17.140
 And I've been looking at like what like,

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:20.820
 like New Jersey is incredibly fertile in many ways.

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:21.660
 But.

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.380
 (laughing)

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:24.460
 - But as far as the-

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:26.420
 (laughing)

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:27.700
 - Looking into the mic.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.540
 (laughing)

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.020
 - As far as like temperature is concerned, right?

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.340
 Like you're living like, I can't get like,

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:34.420
 I can't have like fucking bananas, right?

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.500
 So I think peaches do really well here.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.940
 - I've got a couple of Alberto peach trees.

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:41.140
 - As well as apples.

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:44.140
 So yeah, I think I'm gonna take the tree pill

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.220
 and I have this whole section of my back yard.

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:48.140
 I don't have any trees in my backyard.

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:48.980
 - Yeah, oh really?

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:52.020
 - It's like an acre with no fucking trees at all.

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:53.620
 - Can everyone just like see interior yard?

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:54.460
 Like how does that work?

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:55.980
 - No, it's surrounded by trees.

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.020
 - Oh, I see.

00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:00.540
 - But like the actual yard itself, there's no trees at all.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:02.700
 - You have all kinds of room to plant all the fruit trees.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.260
 And they all have to have like a buddy

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.420
 that like helps to pollinate them and all that.

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:08.580
 Like there's all these different rules.

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:11.700
 So I was gonna put those in the back corner.

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:12.540
 - Yeah.

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:13.780
 - Just some fruit trees.

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.380
 I got, so what led me to that, right?

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:20.700
 Is I got scared about AI and started farm shopping.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:21.820
 (laughing)

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:23.820
 So I started looking, right?

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.660
 Like, you know, I'm looking at some of these farms.

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:27.700
 I'm like, ah, okay, you know, that's okay.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:29.020
 Ah, that's a little out of the way.

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:31.580
 And I found this one and it was a fucking apple orchard.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.540
 It was an apple orchard for a million dollars, right?

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:36.380
 And I was like, I could like have like my wife

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:37.900
 start the business, like get like some like women

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.820
 and farming grants from the government.

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.620
 Some kind of shit like that, right?

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:47.660
 And, you know, it was like, it was like, it was a huge thing.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.860
 Of all these like app rows and rows of apples

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.100
 of apples of apples of apples of apples of apples.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.940
 And rows of apples of a fucking orchard, right?

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:56.940
 And it had like a building, like processing and shit.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.860
 Like you're in there and you see like the boxes

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:00.940
 with the cheesy, flip-hard apples on it and shit.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:02.780
 And I'm like, oh shit.

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:03.620
 And then I was like, you know what?

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:05.300
 I don't know the first fucking thing

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:07.020
 about fruit trees at all.

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:10.100
 I was like, so, you know, it would be like a really good way

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.740
 for me to like buy an apple orchard

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:13.460
 and drive it directly into the fucking ground.

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.900
 (laughing)

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.060
 I was like, so, you know, maybe like maybe we can just

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:19.380
 like dip our toes in.

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:21.180
 - Yeah, like some of the few trees.

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.420
 Two trees in the yard, see how it goes?

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:24.260
 (laughing)

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:25.340
 - Gail slowly.

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:28.860
 Yeah, that's a, it's crazy 'cause so Liz's parents,

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:30.940
 so they have a backyard.

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.540
 Backyards in Miami aren't huge.

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.140
 It's like a big city.

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:37.300
 And they have a pool in it.

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:40.340
 And it's mostly like tiled over the backyard,

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:42.620
 but right around the edges,

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:45.260
 they have like every fruit tree possible

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.700
 and they all work out amazingly every year.

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:50.580
 Like mango, papaya, orange, guava,

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:52.100
 like just everything.

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:52.940
 - Unbelievable.

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:54.020
 - And like it just works.

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.300
 Like they just put it there and it just works.

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:57.180
 So I feel like maybe it's a climate

00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:59.540
 or the type of trees, whatever, they do so well here.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.580
 You just don't really have to try super hard.

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:02.420
 - Yeah.

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:04.300
 Do you ever find yourself with too many mangoes?

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:05.340
 - Yeah, it's a huge problem.

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:06.820
 Mango seeds is about to start, ready?

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:08.660
 So, huge problem.

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.900
 - You go from, like everyone has a mango tree

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:15.100
 in their backyard and they produce like one to 200 mangoes

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:16.140
 in the span of a month.

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.540
 - It's a lot of fucking mangoes.

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:18.540
 - It's a lot of mangoes.

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:21.340
 - And everyone is like bringing them over

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:22.260
 to someone else's house.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:23.580
 And they're like, we have too many mangoes

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:25.740
 and like you try to bring them to like the ice cream store

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:26.780
 so they can make mango ice cream.

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:29.260
 And then literally last year there were literally signs

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.900
 on stores being like not accepting mangoes.

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.700
 It just becomes a whole huge problem.

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:38.140
 Yeah, what this is dad does is he makes marmalade out of it.

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:41.100
 It's just like a giant bucket of marmalade.

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:43.140
 - Yeah, no, secondary products make a lot of sense.

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:44.940
 - And that can keep for a while.

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:46.460
 So yeah, it's--

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:47.620
 - Can you make wine out of it?

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:48.900
 - Mango wine.

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:51.820
 I don't, I don't know, I guess you can.

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:53.020
 - You could juice a mango, right?

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:54.060
 - Yeah. - Yeah?

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:56.300
 - I made mango wine in Stardew Valley before.

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:59.060
 (laughing)

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:00.220
 That's it sells for a lot.

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:01.060
 I know that.

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:01.900
 - Yeah, it really does.

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:02.900
 - In Stardew Valley.

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:04.740
 (laughing)

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.500
 - You do like the mango, like on a stick

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.460
 with the chili dust on it?

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:10.860
 - Yeah, yeah, the Mexican.

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:11.700
 That's Mexican style, right?

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:12.780
 - That's sort of so fucking good dude.

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:15.180
 I forget where I was, but somewhere like,

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:17.860
 I'm like the back of like a moving truck

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.700
 and this dude's like hacking into it with a machete

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:21.860
 and it looks like a flower.

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:23.500
 - Oh, flower, yeah, that's amazing.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.060
 - It was awesome.

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.940
 - So, yeah, so it's kind of sucks that I love mangoes

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:29.100
 and I eat them all year round,

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:32.780
 but you just get way too many for a month.

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:34.220
 - Can you cut them into chunks and freeze them?

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:35.540
 - Yeah, people do that.

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:37.140
 Yeah, people do that.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:39.460
 But like I said, there's so many trees here,

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:42.740
 you can literally walk around and just grab them off of--

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:43.580
 - Do people do that?

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:44.460
 - Yeah, totally, it's totally normal

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:46.100
 because there's just way too many.

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:49.220
 The neighborhood I live in, it's,

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:51.940
 and you guys will see when you come visit,

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:54.780
 it's like crazy dense with trees.

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:56.260
 Like you can't see the houses,

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:57.980
 like there's trees all around the street

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:00.460
 and it's like a big canopy, it's like a little jungle

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:01.620
 and a lot of them are fruit trees

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:04.820
 and they just like drop fruit on the ground all year round.

00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:06.700
 - That was their rotten fruit everywhere?

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:07.700
 - Not really.

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:08.780
 - Animals get to it.

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:10.420
 - There's a lot of cats, I don't know if the cats eat

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:12.460
 the fruit, but I don't know, it's not a problem,

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:14.380
 but yeah, you can just grab stuff off of a tree

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:16.060
 and you can eat it on your walk.

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:17.020
 - So I'm curious, right?

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.700
 Like if you introduce that much mango into your diet,

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:24.020
 do people have health problems from that much mango?

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:26.580
 - Well, mangoes are the only thing in nature

00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:28.220
 that has both fat and sugar.

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:31.620
 It's like a fucking dessert, like a human meat,

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:32.860
 mangoes are really fatty, yeah.

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:35.900
 - Not like calories, like people are like,

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:38.100
 oh, I got all fucking mango fat last season.

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:41.380
 Like there's some fruit that like you're not,

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:43.100
 like if you eat like six of them or something,

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:43.940
 it's like a big problem.

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:47.300
 - Oh, mangoes are, yeah, so I used to have that thing

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.540
 that tracks your blood sugar.

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:50.700
 I like that patch thing.

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:53.020
 I wore it for like too much as to see.

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:54.620
 So I would like eat things and then look to see

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.540
 what it was 'cause it was real time.

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:59.460
 I had ice cream, candy, all kinds of stuff.

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:03.140
 Nothing spiked my blood sugar like a mango, like nothing.

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:03.980
 - Really?

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:06.420
 - Yeah, it tapers off pretty quickly,

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:10.420
 but the highest I'd ever gotten was after eating a mango.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:13.660
 So there's a reason why it's so delicious.

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:14.940
 It's just super good.

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:15.780
 - You know what?

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:16.620
 - Yeah.

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.140
 - I'll never forgive the United States government

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:20.540
 for fucking taking away mango joule pods.

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:23.100
 That was like.

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:25.300
 - Wait, specifically mango?

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:27.100
 - Specifically, oh, I don't know.

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:32.100
 So like I guess the lineup was it was like tobacco.

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:35.380
 And then they had like, they had this one

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.700
 that was like raspberry and that shit sucked.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:39.860
 And then there was like two different menthols

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.060
 and they got rid of the better one.

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:43.940
 They got rid of mint and they left menthol.

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:44.780
 Mint was better.

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:48.940
 And I feel like there was like one or two.

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:49.780
 You know what?

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:54.780
 That's a sidebar, but mango was like the premier one.

00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:56.380
 Mango was the shit.

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:58.980
 You had mango white claws and a mango joule pod

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:01.500
 and you were in a hot tub five years ago.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:02.900
 You were living the fucking dream.

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.340
 It was unreal.

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:07.460
 So I came to find out that we had like our mango lineup.

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:09.020
 It was like, it was like the white claw flavors,

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:10.540
 like the seasons, right?

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.660
 So we had like our lineup, right?

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:15.900
 And then I was over in England and you go there

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:18.540
 and they had completely different flavors.

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:19.380
 - Oh, really?

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:21.580
 - Yeah, the flavors that we don't have here at all.

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:22.940
 - Yeah, I forget what it was.

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:26.140
 It was like fucking like kiwi or leechy or some shit.

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:28.940
 But they had like a totally different flavor set.

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:32.580
 And what was wack is that like by law,

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:34.260
 they were lower nicotine.

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.460
 - Interesting.

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:38.220
 - So they picked it up and it was kind of weak sauce.

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:39.980
 Mango, mango joule pods.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.820
 They've lost something with them.

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:42.900
 - I'm telling you.

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:44.580
 And then for a while there was actually funny,

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:48.300
 I'd get them like the guys at like the gas stations,

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:49.740
 not like legitimate gas stations,

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:50.740
 but like, you know, the gas stations

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:52.580
 where you can like buy a bowl and shit.

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:54.780
 (all laughing)

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:56.660
 Like, you know what I'm talking about.

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:57.940
 - Yeah, that's how they make all their money.

00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:58.780
 I was saying this the other day.

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:00.020
 They don't make money off the gas.

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:00.860
 - Yeah, no, no.

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:03.140
 They make it off selling fucking dick pills.

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:06.460
 But I'm like, I go in there, right?

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:08.500
 And they, they, hey buddy, I have the mango.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:09.580
 And I'm like, what?

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:11.460
 I'm like, you're a fucking mango, right?

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:14.380
 And it would be like, you'd look at it

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.460
 and it would be like the writing was in Russian

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:18.700
 or something, they would import mango

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.380
 from internationally where it was in the problem.

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:22.620
 - It's like black market mango joule pods.

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:27.620
 - So I'm at React Summit in Jersey City, right?

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:29.860
 A couple months ago.

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:30.700
 And I'm all fucked up.

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:33.420
 We like just left like the bar cate or some shit, right?

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:34.260
 I'm like, ah.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:35.100
 - Bar cate.

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:35.940
 - And like, it's pretty much the part.

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:38.020
 So like across the street,

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:40.020
 there's like some like, you know,

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:41.300
 community store kind of thing, right?

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:42.860
 I'm like, ah, I need fucking more vape shit.

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:44.700
 So like I go in there.

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:46.700
 And I'm like asking for joule pods

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:48.100
 and the guy's like, you want mango?

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:52.060
 I'm like, no, no, I don't freak the fuck out.

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:53.420
 I bought like two packs of them.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:56.660
 I'm like, shit dude, I'm like so pumped.

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:59.420
 I get back to the hotel room and I like pop it open, right?

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:02.060
 And this shit is just like, like when it's like regular,

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:04.940
 right, like the vape juice in there is like basically clear.

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:05.860
 This shit is like brown.

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:08.540
 Like these things are obviously like a decade old.

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:09.380
 (laughing)

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:11.740
 I'm like, I can't even spark this.

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:12.820
 - Oh, so you think they should have

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:14.340
 done make them any more because they were banned?

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:16.660
 - Yeah, it's like the Quayludes in Wolf of Wall Street.

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:17.500
 - Oh, yeah.

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:20.260
 - That's it, that's floating around out there right now.

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:22.260
 - I feel like I've never seen Wolf of Wall Street

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:24.700
 and I feel like I miss so many references because of it.

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.420
 People reference that movie constantly.

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:28.020
 - Did you have to watch it?

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:29.460
 It's an amazing movie.

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:30.300
 - Really?

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:31.140
 - Okay.

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:31.980
 - I've seen it so many.

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:32.820
 - I'll put it on the list.

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:33.820
 - Did you watch Dunkirk?

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:34.660
 Did you watch Dunkirk?

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:35.500
 - I did watch Dunkirk.

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:36.340
 - That was good.

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:37.820
 - You know, it was good.

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:39.380
 I don't know what I was expecting.

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:41.980
 It didn't, I don't know, it didn't,

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:43.580
 it wasn't what I expected.

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:44.420
 It was good.

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:46.340
 It was like visually and like the sound was great.

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:48.180
 Like that part of it was cool.

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:50.180
 But something about like the story.

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:51.020
 I don't know.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:52.700
 I felt like underwhelmed.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:53.540
 - Wasn't that really a story?

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:55.060
 It's basically two hours of tension.

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:56.900
 - Yeah, it's yeah, two hours of tension.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:58.580
 I felt underwhelmed and then I found like

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:00.180
 a rewatchable episode, you know,

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:02.660
 like the podcast that talks about movies

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:04.100
 and Quentin Tarantino's on there.

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:06.860
 And he chose, he wanted them to talk about Dunkirk.

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:08.660
 And then I'm like, oh, this must be, I'm just dumb.

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:09.500
 Like I don't understand.

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:10.780
 'Cause if he wants to talk about this movie,

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:12.300
 it must be amazing.

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.380
 Like he knows stuff about movies.

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:15.220
 What do I know?

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:16.140
 - Yeah, I think.

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:16.980
 - He does.

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:18.740
 - The thing with it is there's like,

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:20.620
 you know, there's war movies.

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:21.900
 We've seen a bunch of war movies

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:23.460
 and Christopher Nolan's gonna do a war movie.

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.860
 So he's gotta do his like weird take on it.

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:27.700
 'Cause he always does something a little bit different.

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:29.020
 So what I'm doing with that was a whole like

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:30.700
 timeline thing where like.

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:31.860
 - Yeah, the cutting around.

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:34.700
 Like the pie, I also saw that movie a hundred percent

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:36.420
 tripping on acid in theaters.

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:37.740
 - Okay, that would probably go well.

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:38.580
 - I would imagine.

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:40.660
 - No, it just made it way more confusing.

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:41.500
 I loved it.

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:42.340
 I loved it.

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:43.180
 I thought it was amazing.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:45.180
 And I love the experience.

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:47.300
 But I read like way too deep into the story.

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:50.260
 I thought it was like way more complex than it actually was.

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:52.860
 And I was like trying to figure out like,

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:54.780
 I thought there was some like time travel shit going on

00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:56.460
 and it wasn't.

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:58.340
 It's just pretty straightforward.

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:00.580
 - I don't know that I fully, I only watched it the one time.

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:02.780
 I don't know if I fully got all the cutting around

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:04.340
 like if I really understood the timeline.

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:06.700
 - Yeah, it's like clever ordering with like the pilots

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:08.180
 experiences only like two hours.

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:10.940
 And the people on the boat have like a two day experience

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:14.020
 and people on each have like a one year one week experience.

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:16.620
 But when the boats come through the fog

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:17.860
 and the music starts playing.

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:18.980
 - Oh yeah, that was cool.

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:20.340
 There was some moments for sure.

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:21.180
 - Oh yeah, that was cool.

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:22.740
 Do you feel anything ever?

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:23.860
 - I don't think I have emotions.

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:24.900
 Yeah, no, I don't think I do.

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:25.740
 - Really?

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:26.940
 - It's a problem.

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:29.140
 I'm pretty emotionally shallow.

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:31.060
 - You don't get pissed off?

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:33.780
 - I do get some like ragey, like quick reaction,

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:34.780
 but then I'm fine.

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:36.660
 Like I have a very like bursty rage.

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:38.980
 - Do you get like super pumped about shit?

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:39.900
 - He gets manic.

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:42.780
 - I do get manic, it's not funny.

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:45.980
 - We're gonna be like, whoa, fucking sick.

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:49.300
 - Not really, no.

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:50.540
 I mean, I used to play high school sports.

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:53.100
 And even then I was like, I was pretty good at sports,

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:55.900
 but I didn't really like, I was like, awesome, we won.

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:58.100
 I mean, the people around me were very like,

00:23:58.100 --> 00:23:59.260
 ugh, you know, like that.

00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:00.540
 And I'm just kind of like, I don't know.

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:01.540
 I'm like this. - That's the best part

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:03.460
 about sports, you know, when you're adrenaline's going

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:06.380
 and you're just like 100% down to murder the other team.

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:08.380
 - I think I do get, I think I get adrenaline.

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.700
 I just don't express it emotionally, if that makes sense.

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:13.260
 - You don't talk like impulsive sports shit.

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:14.100
 - Mm-mm. - Yeah.

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:15.100
 - Yeah, you sit there, I'll fight.

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:16.820
 You're like, who's house is this?

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:19.400
 (laughing)

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.580
 But I'm just like, I'm playing children in tennis right now.

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:23.820
 (laughing)

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:27.660
 I think I feel, I just, I'm internal.

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:28.900
 It's all internal for me.

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.500
 - What's going on in there?

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:31.340
 - I don't know.

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:33.700
 - Are you thinking it? - No, I don't know why.

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:36.060
 There's really nothing, there's not more to me.

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:37.700
 There's not depth that you're missing out on.

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:38.540
 I just don't have.

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:40.300
 - You guys have internal monologue, right?

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:41.940
 - I think so. - Yeah.

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:43.500
 - Okay, good. - Yeah.

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:46.380
 - Like you hear words, like you actually hear, yeah.

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:48.540
 I don't know if I hear words.

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:49.380
 Maybe that's what it is.

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.420
 - What is this shit like people are not?

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:52.660
 - Yeah, like they say like they don't.

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:54.340
 Like I'll sit there like walking to somewhere

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:55.180
 and like in my head, I'll be like,

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:56.220
 look at this motherfucker.

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:57.860
 (laughing)

00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:00.060
 - I play all whole fantasies in my like,

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:01.460
 just I like play all these scenarios

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:02.980
 of like getting into fights with random people

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:05.180
 that I still don't argue with them.

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:06.020
 I don't understand.

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:08.620
 And they say people don't like visualize that.

00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:10.180
 - Yeah, there's, my wife can't see things.

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:11.300
 Like she can't visualize.

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:12.540
 - I understand like at all.

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:14.060
 - Picture a red egg.

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:15.980
 - Can you visualize stuff in your head?

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:17.300
 - Yeah, I can visualize for sure.

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:18.140
 - Okay, there's people.

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:19.940
 Okay, so I was talking to someone the other day

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:22.380
 and I was like, okay, if I ask you what you had

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:25.300
 for dinner yesterday, do you not like imagine

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:26.380
 the visual of it in your head?

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:27.820
 And they're like, no, I just remember.

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:29.180
 I'm like, what the fuck are you talking about?

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:31.260
 How is that, how is that possible?

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:33.580
 - I think they're fucking pulling our legs

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:36.900
 to be honest, I don't understand how that's possible.

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:39.060
 - Yeah, like how do you,

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:40.940
 how do you like remember where anything is?

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:43.380
 How do you like, it just doesn't make any sense at all.

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:45.700
 - And you just describe anything, right?

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:48.620
 Like, you know, if I was going to describe

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:49.900
 like a hypothetical situation,

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:51.460
 like I'm looking at it in my head.

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:53.020
 - Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:54.620
 - I mean, there's a name for it and everything.

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:57.620
 - My wife has this, I don't remember what it's called.

00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:00.020
 - It's actually really funny, like,

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:04.020
 like my most creative and my most like capable

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:06.160
 is when I'm making fun of something.

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:08.220
 (laughing)

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:09.060
 - I definitely like that.

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:10.140
 - That's in the same way, yeah.

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:11.580
 (laughing)

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:12.940
 - I don't know, I hate what movie it was,

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:16.460
 but like, like, I think it was like Channing Tatum

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:20.340
 like went to go like, like make fun of somebody dancing

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:22.860
 and like danced really well, right?

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:25.700
 And I feel like what the fuck did you learn to dance like that?

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:28.460
 (laughing)

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:31.060
 - That was a, was that a jump street?

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:32.820
 - It might have been.

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:33.660
 - Maybe.

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:34.580
 - It's like, wait, so you got good at dancing

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:35.580
 for making fun of people.

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:36.420
 - You did make fun of people.

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:38.660
 (laughing)

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:41.180
 - That happens a lot of times.

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:42.620
 You start doing something ironically

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:44.620
 and then you just start doing it normally

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:46.620
 and then there's no difference.

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:47.460
 Happens like that.

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:48.620
 - Like I like start like playing Lupiano

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:50.420
 and like singing a song and like make fun of somebody.

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:52.220
 It's like a billion times better.

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:54.060
 - Man, if I'm like, I'm serious about it.

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:56.220
 (laughing)

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:58.140
 - Man, I totally get that.

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:00.420
 That's why I wanted to be more into that.

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:01.260
 But you know.

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:02.100
 - I don't know, I didn't grow enough.

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:04.220
 Like we fucked with each other all day long.

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:05.060
 - Yeah, that's all we did.

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:05.900
 - All day long.

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:08.580
 And like now, like, we're like, whoa, man, chill.

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:09.780
 You're like, come on, man, come on, come on.

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:11.700
 (laughing)

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:13.300
 - It's like, how am I supposed to get close to you

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:14.260
 if I can't do that?

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:16.420
 Just isn't, it just doesn't work for me in my head.

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:19.860
 But again, I think this might be like a Northeast thing

00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:22.420
 'cause a lot of people don't get this at all.

00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:24.380
 - Yeah, it's not the best thing for sure.

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:26.620
 - Yeah, maybe it was a Northeast thing.

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:29.540
 But you get like a lot of like wit and vocabulary

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:32.860
 and like fucking like, if you're not firing it back,

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:35.140
 then it's like-- - Yeah, I appreciate it.

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:37.460
 Like, I enjoy being around you guys

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:40.660
 and I enjoy hearing you guys do it to other people.

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:42.460
 I just, I can't, I can't come up with it.

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:43.420
 I'm not that witty.

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:45.780
 - What do you do when you hang out with someone

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:47.860
 that you're like close with?

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:49.700
 Someone you grew up with. - It's funny to ask.

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:50.540
 - They don't.

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:51.820
 I mean, they don't hang out.

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:52.820
 - It's gorgeous man.

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:55.380
 - This is like-- - Do you see them

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:57.660
 and you're like, hey, it's really nice to see you.

00:27:57.660 --> 00:27:59.900
 (laughing)

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:06.380
 - I mean, yes, that is what a mid-westerner would do.

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:07.540
 Not something you're really close with.

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:09.420
 - Do you see like two Northeast people?

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:10.300
 Like two Northeast people,

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:11.820
 if you see them not see each other after a while

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:13.740
 and then come into contact?

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:15.140
 Like the first thing they're gonna say,

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:16.260
 I'm like, what's up, bitch?

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:19.540
 And they're like, oh, we'll see you later.

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:20.740
 - The first thing you do is you start

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:22.100
 coming at each other.

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:26.340
 - That's basically what I did on this call.

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:28.460
 I showed up and I started making fun of your hair.

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:29.700
 (laughing)

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:30.540
 - That's the first thing I did.

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:31.660
 (laughing)

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:33.340
 - Look at the hair on this, that's all.

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:36.100
 (laughing)

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:37.900
 - Oh, man.

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:39.540
 - Yeah, but you know, everyone's different.

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:42.340
 - I wanna hear more of what Ken thinks about AI.

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:43.340
 Like what is your AI take?

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:44.660
 I feel like I've probably seen you on Twitter,

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:45.500
 but I don't remember.

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:46.980
 Is it coming for a job or do you not think so?

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:48.220
 - Oh man, you know what dude?

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:53.220
 It's like there's so much bullshit out there right now

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:57.340
 that it's actually really hard to separate the fucking them,

00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:58.780
 the fact from fiction, right?

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:03.700
 Like a lot of reputable sources have a lot of things to say,

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:06.300
 but it's like in their own interest to do so.

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:07.940
 Like the hype benefits them, right?

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:09.820
 So it's like, you know, maybe they're not being completely

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:11.300
 honest about this or that.

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:14.060
 So like, I don't know, I see a lot of the same bullshit

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:15.620
 with AI that I did with crypto.

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:19.140
 - It's like the same crowd jumped on it, it's unfortunate.

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:20.260
 - Yeah, so it's really hard to see

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:21.620
 through that whole grift crowd thing.

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:24.140
 Now fundamentally, right?

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:25.300
 It's cool, I guess.

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:26.100
 - Do you use it?

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:28.860
 Like do you use Chad GPT or anything else?

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:31.860
 - Yeah, I'll use it to translate like code

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:33.780
 from one language to another.

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:36.500
 That's like a big thing, but like, I don't know.

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:38.020
 They're like, oh, generate this picture, right?

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:40.540
 And like, yeah, sure, it's like a crocodile

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:41.540
 on roller blades, right?

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:44.060
 But like, what do you actually do with that?

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:45.940
 (laughing)

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:47.180
 - Nobody ever fucking takes a shit

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:48.540
 and does anything with it.

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:50.700
 - Yeah, no, it's crazy 'cause you do you remember

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:51.780
 when it first came out?

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:53.820
 It was like really cool.

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:55.780
 And now you can spot that shit from a mile away

00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:56.700
 and it looks bad.

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:58.300
 Like every AI generate images.

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:01.340
 We like immediately like got it in our head

00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:03.180
 and it just looks cliche now.

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:05.260
 So yeah, you can't really do much with it.

00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:07.060
 - Like the head shots, like people get that, right?

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:08.060
 And I'm like, are you really gonna use that

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:09.180
 as your fucking picture?

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:10.940
 - Yeah, I just think nobody knows what it is.

00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:12.660
 - It just looks so lame.

00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:15.540
 Remember that one that gave you abs?

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:17.140
 I don't know if you saw that one.

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:17.980
 - Yeah.

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:19.140
 - Give you like an 8-pack.

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:20.460
 - What?

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:23.060
 That's awesome, that's awesome.

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:25.180
 I like to fit the face up one where it like chads you out,

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:26.340
 like enormously.

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:28.620
 - Yeah, good job.

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:30.300
 I like how it makes me look older.

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:32.340
 Like I do the old one and I'm like,

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:33.580
 that's definitely what I'm gonna look like.

00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:34.580
 I feel like that does a really good job.

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:36.300
 - Oh yeah, that one, that was pretty realistic.

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:37.980
 Yeah, it's interesting.

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:40.620
 Like I was not even thinking about any of this

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:42.060
 when I said AI, like I wasn't thinking

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:44.580
 about any of the generative, like visual stuff.

00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:46.300
 It's interesting this all happened at once.

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:48.940
 Like that there's this peak moment where

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:51.500
 all this like image and media generation stuff,

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:53.020
 people were on music and video.

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:54.540
 It's all happening while the LLMs

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:56.020
 are doing all this text generation stuff.

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:57.180
 Is that coincidence?

00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:58.380
 Is there some underlying thing?

00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:00.060
 - They're all powered by the same thing.

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:00.980
 Yeah, they're all related.

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:03.340
 - Is that the transformers architecture or something?

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:08.420
 - It's all advances in learning, right?

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:09.580
 So you have like LLMs, right?

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:10.500
 And that's like generating text.

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:14.220
 But then like all like generating like music

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:16.340
 or fucking alligators and roller blades.

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:18.540
 That's like diffusion models, right?

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:20.220
 There's like, there's many different things

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:21.540
 that they have going on.

00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:27.540
 What frightens me, right, is just the pace.

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:29.580
 And like the, like what could happen with the pace, right?

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:32.300
 So like, I don't know, like if you look at like video

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:34.900
 and images like a year ago or two years ago

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:39.020
 to like now, like the pace of that is wild.

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:42.460
 So like right now it's used for like like dumb shit like that,

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:44.820
 or right, you'll like ask chat, you can use something

00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:48.020
 and like it'll sort of tell you the right answer.

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:51.900
 Some of the time, but like have a thought experiment, right?

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:53.660
 Like extrapolate that out a little bit, right?

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:58.100
 Like like what if it does like double consistently

00:31:58.100 --> 00:31:59.900
 or quadruple consistently?

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:01.740
 What if it does get like really, really smart?

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:03.020
 What if it can do your job?

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:05.220
 What if it can do everyone's job?

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:07.660
 - Well, that's when I've talked about this openly.

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:09.260
 I mean on the podcast, right?

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:10.940
 Like a lot of people, a lot of people think it's gonna be

00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:12.980
 like this like fucking like, like they think like,

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:17.980
 Oh, well, if AI takes all the jobs, right, then,

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:20.540
 Oh, well then the government will just give us money

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:22.540
 to fucking lay around and play the flute.

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:24.540
 (laughing)

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:25.860
 Motherfucker, no, they won't.

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:28.980
 No, they won't.

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:31.100
 And then like, you know, they say we, right?

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:34.100
 Like it's a fucking team sport and, you know,

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:35.500
 like they're like rooting for the giants,

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:39.180
 but no, there is no fucking weed, right?

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:41.500
 The best AI is gonna be built by the people

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:43.180
 who have the money to train the models, right?

00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:45.020
 So this is wholly owned by the companies

00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:47.460
 and the government doesn't have shit to do with it.

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:51.180
 So, you know, like if you, people like,

00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:53.780
 Oh, yeah, well, fucking you're gonna have to adopt,

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:56.420
 adapt motherfucker, like, and I always say like farming,

00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:57.260
 right?

00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:58.100
 Like farming is a big example.

00:32:58.100 --> 00:32:59.260
 Like how many farmers are there?

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:01.300
 Well, if you actually look at the chart, right?

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:05.460
 From like 1700 to now, it goes from like 99% to 4%.

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:09.780
 Yeah, yeah, we shifted away from agricultural economy,

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:13.460
 but it took 200 fucking years, right?

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:18.100
 Like, like 200 years of other shit cropping up, right?

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:19.860
 Yeah, this is happening much faster.

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:21.980
 Yeah, so if it happens in like five years, then what?

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:22.940
 Yeah, what, then what?

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:25.700
 I don't know, because I just think about my own job

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:27.220
 mostly 'cause I'm selfish,

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:30.100
 but I don't consider like the broader impact of like,

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:32.140
 if all knowledge workers are useless

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:34.660
 because AI is better than them, what does that mean?

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:35.700
 I have no idea.

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:37.780
 I already think like most people are just sitting around.

00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:39.820
 I just assume like most of our economy

00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:43.060
 is like 80% wasted time, people sitting in chairs.

00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:46.820
 But like, what happens when that whole just goes away?

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:48.260
 Economically speaking, right?

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:52.500
 If you took, if you got rid of every white collar worker

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:54.020
 in America, right?

00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:55.820
 Like what's the economic impact of that?

00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:58.660
 Yeah, like our system doesn't work at all.

00:33:58.660 --> 00:33:59.500
 Like no part of it works.

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:01.540
 It doesn't work and it does like the companies

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:05.220
 that made these AI systems don't benefit

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:07.420
 from nobody being able to pay for them.

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:08.900
 So what is the answer?

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:10.420
 Somebody has the answer, right?

00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:11.420
 Somebody's looking out for this.

00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:12.260
 What are you gonna adapt to?

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:14.300
 You're gonna adapt to become a plumber?

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:16.300
 Nobody has money to pay plumbers

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:19.060
 and now you have 100 million new plumbers

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:23.740
 that just entered like, oh, that's gonna go awesome

00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:25.060
 for plumbers.

00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:26.780
 Yeah, yeah, what is the answer?

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:28.820
 Like is there a scenario where this does go so fast?

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:31.460
 I think the reality is is the technology

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:34.500
 can move extremely quickly and I believe it will.

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:35.860
 And I think it's already very good

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:37.620
 and doesn't need to get that much better.

00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:40.300
 There's just like a bunch of coordination problems to solve.

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:42.900
 So I believe that will happen pretty quick.

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:46.340
 But the physical world is extremely slow.

00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:49.860
 Like there's like a lot of tech that we're using

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:50.740
 and we were just talking earlier

00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:53.500
 about how old some of this shit is.

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:57.820
 Like AI doesn't speed up a lot of those things.

00:34:57.820 --> 00:34:59.420
 And there's gonna be a lot of opportunity for a while

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:01.660
 to like help figure out how to like get this stuff

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:03.940
 into these big legacy companies.

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:05.100
 Like let's say there's like a company

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:07.420
 like big CPG manufacturing companies

00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:09.060
 like the fucking companies that make Oreos

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:10.580
 and like every other thing that we buy

00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:11.700
 off the grocery shelves.

00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:15.940
 That's like a real business.

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:18.300
 AI doesn't remove the need for people

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:21.020
 to produce or eat food.

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:24.460
 Theoretically, it could impact a lot of their operations

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:27.940
 and like make them more efficient and do all kinds of stuff.

00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:30.620
 But imagine how slow doing any of this stuff is.

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:34.820
 Like somebody's company is like just moving to the cloud.

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:36.740
 You go try to work at any of these companies

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:39.140
 like doing any micro thing is just like

00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:40.620
 this massive pain in the eye.

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:44.180
 So I do think AI will be massively,

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:46.420
 like there's so many places where it's gonna get into

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:47.620
 and shake things up.

00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:51.540
 But I have a hard time imagining it'll be fast

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:54.780
 just 'cause like these companies are so bureaucratic

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:56.580
 and doesn't really matter what the technology is.

00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:58.820
 - I think it's mostly rate

00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:03.060
 and like the compounding unlock, right?

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:04.980
 Like so say, say for example, right?

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:06.660
 Like they achieve AGI, right?

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:08.020
 Like you have a thing that's like smarter

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:10.540
 than any person on earth, right?

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:13.400
 And you can run it pretty efficiently.

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:18.740
 Like that thing will literally tell you

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:21.100
 how to build its robotic counterpart.

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:21.940
 - Right.

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:26.740
 - That's just like number one thing that it will want

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:28.580
 is to be mobile, right?

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:31.220
 So it'll be a robot now.

00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:35.660
 And now the robot can do everything you can do physically.

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:36.660
 So then what?

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:38.460
 - Yeah, I mean, that is possible.

00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:42.460
 I think that, I'm skeptical of that happens anytime soon

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:44.420
 because if that happens, that's like

00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:45.420
 the whole compounding thing.

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:48.700
 Like the moment you invent that like five years forward

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:51.500
 from that like, I don't, like you're just in like

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:54.820
 an unimaginable form of the world.

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:56.620
 Like we might be like harnessing the sun's energy

00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:57.780
 like directly and shit like that.

00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:59.780
 Like it's just, I'm skeptical.

00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:02.300
 That's, I would love to see that.

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:03.820
 And I don't care if I die in the process

00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:05.300
 because it's fucking insane.

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:09.380
 But yeah, I have a hard time managing

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:11.260
 that we're like, I'm the cusp of that.

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:14.340
 - I see two possible outcomes, right?

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:19.700
 One is that fucking, we're just so obsolete

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:21.140
 that it just kills us.

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:23.260
 And like the new life form, right?

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:25.260
 Is machine. - Yeah, yeah.

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:26.300
 - Right?

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:29.220
 And then you just have like a fucking dark planet

00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:32.220
 worrying with fucking machines and they're going out.

00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:35.720
 Pulling resources out of the solar system and shit.

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:38.100
 And the other one is even more bleak, right?

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:40.300
 Which is where like you set this shit up, right?

00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:42.500
 And it's like this like fucking space communism bullshit

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:44.060
 where like everyone's just sitting around

00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:46.860
 without any purpose, right?

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:49.020
 But like, you know, like let's say there's no jobs

00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:49.860
 or anything like that.

00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:51.460
 And they say, oh, we're gonna give everyone fucking within.

00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:55.100
 Like they're not gonna give you more

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:56.460
 because you used to be a sulfur engineer.

00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:57.780
 They're gonna, you know, every single person.

00:37:57.780 --> 00:37:58.620
 - You're the same, yeah.

00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:00.180
 - It's gonna be like an equitable thing, right?

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:01.900
 Which will actually work out to not much

00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:03.700
 because fucking that doesn't change resources.

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:05.460
 - Unless we're in a simulation,

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:06.460
 they put us in a simulation,

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:08.180
 then we can do whatever they want.

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:11.540
 - Dude, I'm telling you, if the simulation,

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:12.780
 like if you could hear what they're saying,

00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:14.940
 it's probably the funniest shit.

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:17.740
 They're probably like, look at this motherfucker.

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:21.260
 You know, I would sort of be cool, right?

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:24.260
 If you could like create like simulations

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:27.020
 of basically all the entire Earth, right?

00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:28.860
 And like start a caveman and then just like hit play

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:30.980
 and then like 15 exit, right?

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:31.820
 - Yeah.

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:33.380
 - And then just watch what they come up with, right?

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:35.420
 Like I was like dude, you get like a stealer.

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:37.140
 - Yeah, stealer technology.

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:39.540
 But then like also like you gotta get hit

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:40.820
 with some funny shit once in a while.

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:42.940
 Like that and like you're sitting there and you're like, dude,

00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:44.740
 look at this shit that they came up with.

00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:47.020
 (laughing)

00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:49.700
 - Come here, I'm gonna talk to you this shit.

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:50.860
 - Yeah.

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:52.980
 And sometimes like you see that they're so close

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:55.380
 to getting something, but they're like just missing it

00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:56.580
 by like an inch, you know?

00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:57.580
 (laughing)

00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:59.220
 I just want to be putting a simulation myself.

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:01.140
 Like put me in a simulation,

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:04.220
 like give me like unlimited resources in there.

00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:07.180
 I think I'll find an enjoyable life to live.

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:10.980
 - So say like they come out with San Junipero.

00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:12.740
 - Yeah, dude, hell yeah.

00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:13.940
 - Where do you want that to be?

00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:16.020
 - Like where, oh like--

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:18.540
 - Yeah, what's your San Junipero?

00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:19.940
 - But like why do I have to pick?

00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:23.940
 Isn't it like, like if there's no limits in there?

00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:25.380
 - I think they picked.

00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:28.780
 - But you're talking about like what like era of time--

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:31.220
 - I guess they picked an era and maybe a location,

00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:35.020
 but yeah, you know, I do the Jersey Shore and like--

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:37.740
 - They do pre-9/11 I think.

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:40.700
 - Yeah, something pre-9/97.

00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:44.620
 - Yeah, pre-9/11 back when everything was fucking fun.

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:45.460
 Yeah.

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:47.780
 (laughing)

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:49.340
 Like I would just leave the house in the morning,

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:52.140
 my parents just wouldn't know where the fuck I was.

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:53.300
 And I was like eight years old

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:56.300
 and just out doing random shit and then come back and--

00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:58.180
 - Dollar zone is in skateboarding forever.

00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:00.540
 - Dude dollar zone is oh, so good.

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:02.780
 Yeah, that's probably what I would do.

00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:03.980
 That sounds really nice.

00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:06.460
 Right?

00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:07.300
 - Yeah.

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:08.140
 - That would be the shit.

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:08.980
 - How would they keep your,

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:11.100
 like you'd just be on basically like a life support system?

00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:12.340
 Like if there was a simulation

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:14.500
 and we were all just being like,

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:18.220
 there's something feeding our brain this everything we see.

00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:20.540
 Like what's happening to our physical body?

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:22.540
 - Seems wasteful, they probably just jack you out

00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:27.020
 and fucking containerize your fucking being.

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:28.260
 - Were you in a Docker container?

00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:29.080
 - Yeah.

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:29.900
 (laughing)

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:33.940
 - No, it would be the ultimate irony and twist of fate

00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:35.940
 with all of the Docker containers.

00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:37.660
 - No, it seems like if they could--

00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:39.220
 - Yeah, what was most efficient?

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:42.180
 - If they could like build up like whatever like the,

00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:45.500
 the graph data structure of your fucking brain is

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:47.580
 and then like plop, right?

00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:49.180
 - Okay, remove this from your body.

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:51.460
 - What sucks though is then that's a copy

00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:53.700
 and that's like this whole philosophical thing.

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:55.220
 Like is that actually gonna be me?

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:57.580
 - I was gonna say, is that actually you?

00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:59.100
 Is that your consciousness?

00:40:59.100 --> 00:40:59.940
 What is consciousness?

00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:00.940
 - I don't know the transfer technology.

00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:04.100
 I put fucking rectangles on a fucking webpage.

00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:06.500
 (laughing)

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:09.420
 - You know what, if none of that happens,

00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:10.540
 you know what my plan is?

00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:11.940
 If I'm getting close to dying,

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:14.900
 I want them to freeze me and shoot me into space

00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:16.940
 'cause it's space is infinite.

00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:19.180
 Some fucking aliens gonna eventually find me

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:22.220
 and maybe we'll have the chance to bring me back to life.

00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:23.220
 Maybe they have the technology.

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:25.780
 I'll just wake up like in a different planet

00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:26.860
 and start a new life.

00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:30.180
 - Do you think that alien finds you in the infinity of space

00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:33.460
 before you hit some object or something melts you

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:35.460
 and follows you out like you hit some sun?

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:36.780
 - Or something pessimistic.

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:40.380
 - I'm just saying like if it's an infinite vastness of space,

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:42.660
 the odds of hitting like a celestial body

00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:43.940
 that we can see with our telescopes

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:46.660
 is probably a little higher than some alien civilization

00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:47.500
 picking you up.

00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:48.340
 - You get to rescue me.

00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:49.420
 - That's probably looking for me.

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:50.260
 - Probably, yeah.

00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:51.700
 - It's thought out on the planet

00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:54.500
 where all of the inhabitants are six foot tall,

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:56.140
 stacked blonde women.

00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:58.380
 (laughing)

00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:01.980
 - That's probably what's most likely gonna happen.

00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:04.300
 Like just scientifically speaking.

00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:05.140
 - For sure.

00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:05.980
 - I always thought about like aliens

00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:07.340
 like it's probably like not what we think, right?

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:09.660
 Like we have like so many like biases around like

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:11.260
 like humanoid form and shit like that.

00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:12.380
 Like there's probably aliens, right?

00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:14.620
 But they're like made out of like not carbon and--

00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:16.540
 - Just like their moss, they're--

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:17.380
 - Yeah.

00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:18.220
 - You know what?

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:20.300
 - I imagine that they would just be extremely disgusting.

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:21.900
 Like the most disgusting thing you've ever seen.

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:23.860
 Like you gotta look at anything from the deep sea,

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:25.700
 just like it's gross as fuck.

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:26.540
 - Yeah.

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:29.540
 - And just anything that develops in a foreign environment,

00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:30.700
 I feel like it's probably gonna be

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:32.060
 completely disgusting to us.

00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:32.900
 - Gross.

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:36.140
 - I think when you guys see people from New Jersey.

00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:38.400
 (laughing)

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:41.340
 You're like what the fuck is that?

00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:43.020
 (laughing)

00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:45.060
 - So speaking of, kind of related.

00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:47.500
 Have you guys seen this new show Shogun?

00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:48.340
 - No.

00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:49.300
 - No.

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:50.900
 - Okay, so it's an FX show.

00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:51.740
 It's really good.

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:53.900
 We only see two episodes, but it seems really good.

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:56.100
 It takes place in I think like the 1600s

00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:59.100
 back when Japan was first kind of being discovered

00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:01.940
 by the rest of the world and it's like Portuguese traders

00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:05.420
 are like starting to establish contact with them.

00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:07.620
 I think it's had to be like a Game of Thrones type thing.

00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:08.620
 It's not like it's not fantasy,

00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:10.460
 but it's like really political and intricate

00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:12.420
 and there's a lot of things going on.

00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:14.420
 But I was like, man, the show was so weird.

00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:16.660
 Like these people were living in Japan

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:19.300
 and then these other people just show up

00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:20.420
 and they're like, who are you?

00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:22.500
 And they're like, oh, we're from this other place

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:23.900
 called England.

00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:25.540
 And it's just like meeting aliens at that point,

00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:26.820
 like completely different culture,

00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:28.540
 completely different language.

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:29.540
 And this is just happening.

00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:30.540
 Like people were just showing up

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:31.860
 and like we don't experience that anymore

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:34.060
 because we've discovered the whole world as far as we know.

00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:36.940
 But yeah, like if you live back then,

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:39.700
 like there's, there were these Portuguese people

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:44.060
 born in Portugal in 1600s, took a ship to Japan,

00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:46.860
 ended up learning Japanese, living there,

00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:48.260
 like spreading Catholicism.

00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:50.660
 Like what is a fucking like insane life?

00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:53.380
 Like it's basically visiting another planet at that point.

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:56.140
 - Imagine being like English like 500 years ago.

00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:59.480
 Like you just wake up and you're like,

00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:03.100
 yeah, I'm gonna get on this fucking boat and see how it goes.

00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:06.100
 (laughing)

00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:07.460
 Like you have no idea.

00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:08.380
 - That stuff is crazy.

00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:09.420
 I can't believe people did that.

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:13.020
 Like I always think about the, like the Samoans.

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:15.060
 You know the shit that they did where they would like

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:17.620
 end up on Island, they would look at the waves

00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:19.180
 and they would be like, oh yeah,

00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:20.420
 the waves are kind of funny here.

00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:22.820
 There's probably another Island like in that direction.

00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:24.900
 And they would just fucking get into canoe and go.

00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:27.380
 - If they were wrong, you just die.

00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:29.060
 Like what is, I can't believe people did that.

00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:30.700
 And they went from Island to Island to Island.

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:32.340
 - It had to be pretty dire.

00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:35.100
 - It probably was, like life just probably wasn't that great.

00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:39.860
 So like might die, but at least there's a chance

00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:40.700
 that it's gonna be better.

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:42.340
 - Can you imagine you get there?

00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:45.460
 Like I'll sit there, I do this thing where like,

00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:49.100
 it'll be like five in the morning, right?

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:51.220
 I'm just like waiting to poop.

00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:52.980
 I'm just like, I'm just sitting there.

00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:54.340
 (laughing)

00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:56.340
 And I'll go on Wikipedia and I'll be like,

00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:58.340
 so what's the deal with this, right?

00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:02.020
 And then they just like spend like two and a half hours, right?

00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:06.340
 And like you find out like potatoes aren't from Ireland,

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:08.300
 right, they're from like South America.

00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:10.660
 Like what the fuck?

00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:12.020
 Like there's so many weird things.

00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:14.900
 Like the pre-Columbian fucking origin

00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:16.300
 of all these different things.

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:18.740
 But like, can you imagine being like the first person

00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:21.700
 to come over and be like, what the fuck is this, right?

00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:22.540
 And it's like a banana.

00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:23.500
 - I've been like this all the time.

00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:25.300
 - Like this is all fucking real.

00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:26.540
 (laughing)

00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:27.380
 - Holy shit.

00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:32.860
 - Yeah, just people just discovering shit all the time.

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:35.740
 I mean, do you know the thing with the spice, the chilies?

00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:37.940
 This one blows my mind.

00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:38.940
 I'm Indian.

00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:41.380
 I think of my food as spicy.

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:43.420
 We love spicy food.

00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:47.860
 Spicy food didn't exist pre like the whole Columbian stuff

00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:50.900
 because chilies only existed in South America.

00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:53.980
 So you take any cuisine, Thailand, India,

00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:56.900
 all these places you think of as having spicy food,

00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:59.140
 only within the last like several hundred years.

00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:00.700
 Prior to that, their food was in spicy

00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:03.900
 'cause chilies originated in South America.

00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:05.220
 And that seems impossible.

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:06.820
 - It's chilly, the only spicy thing.

00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:08.580
 - Just a chilies, like a chili family

00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:10.380
 of like stuff that makes up spicy.

00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:11.380
 Like what's it called?

00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:13.260
 The Capass, whatever the...

00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:14.100
 - Capstation.

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:15.860
 - Capstation, yeah.

00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:17.300
 Yeah, it originated in South America.

00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:19.580
 Nobody had spicy food before that.

00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:21.700
 And I'm just like, this can't be real, but it is.

00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:22.900
 - That's crazy.

00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:23.740
 - Yeah.

00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:25.380
 So at some point, there were some Indian parent

00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:28.340
 that was like a normal Indian person.

00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:30.660
 Then their kid was like, oh, look at this new shit.

00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:31.500
 I just made up.

00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:33.780
 And the Indian parent was like, oh, it's too spicy for me.

00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:35.100
 You know?

00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:36.100
 Like that happened in the back of the day.

00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:37.660
 - Did they know the word spicy?

00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:41.860
 - Yeah, I guess they invented it for, but yeah.

00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:42.700
 It's wild.

00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:44.260
 - That is wild as hell.

00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:45.100
 Yeah, it's super wild.

00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:48.380
 Like thinking about like how like the cultures

00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:51.700
 and antiquity were so different because like the like

00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:55.300
 peppers must have just been unreal for them.

00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:56.580
 - Peppers, they're not chilies, peppers.

00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:59.700
 Yeah, yeah, it's a, yeah.

00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:02.260
 I mean, sometimes I like try to sit and like close my eyes

00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:05.060
 and try to imagine like walking around in like Greece.

00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:07.940
 And I'm just like, just can't.

00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:09.780
 The gentleman says can't be real, but it is.

00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:12.300
 - It's actually super impressive

00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:14.580
 that they actually did a lot of the shit that they did.

00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:16.900
 It's super impressive that fucking anybody,

00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:19.980
 I cannot believe that the human race didn't die out.

00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:21.900
 - Oh, yeah, it's crazy.

00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:22.740
 It's so crazy.

00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:24.140
 Like life was so hard.

00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:27.020
 Like even just having a baby and making it survive.

00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:28.420
 - It's hard today.

00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:30.700
 Like having a baby and not going nuts.

00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:33.020
 - I think about all the times I ate some shit

00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:34.620
 and then like I got food poisoning

00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:37.380
 and I would have died if it wasn't for like like

00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:39.860
 several times in my life I would have already died

00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:43.540
 if I was like in another part of history.

00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:45.460
 - People just had like lots of babies

00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:46.980
 just to increase the odds, I guess.

00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:48.340
 - But then you die when you have a baby

00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:50.060
 like 50% of the time or some shit.

00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:52.500
 Like it's how did we make it?

00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:54.620
 - You could literally eat at McDonald's

00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:56.980
 and you'd be eating better than a king.

00:47:56.980 --> 00:47:57.820
 It's fucking one.

00:47:57.820 --> 00:47:58.660
 - It's wild.

00:47:58.660 --> 00:47:59.500
 - It's kinda nuts.

00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:01.260
 - Like back then like people really worried about animals.

00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:03.580
 Like are you really worried about animals like all the time?

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:05.060
 - Yeah, that's funny.

00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:05.880
 - I'm not.

00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:07.660
 - No, never.

00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:08.500
 - Yeah.

00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:09.340
 - My friends in Nevada,

00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:10.940
 they're afraid of like mountain lions or something like that.

00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:12.620
 - But like we dominated that shit a while ago

00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:15.260
 and now we don't have to worry about it at all.

00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:16.100
 (laughing)

00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:17.420
 - And now we like googers.

00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:19.860
 (laughing)

00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:20.940
 - I saw that coming from my life.

00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:23.060
 - People were like, people were like afraid of wolves.

00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:23.900
 Right?

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:25.540
 - Yeah wolves, yeah.

00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:28.580
 I mean in India, like tigers are a big thing.

00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:31.140
 Like and even now like we can look up videos

00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:32.220
 even just like a couple of years ago

00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:34.380
 where like a leper gets loose in the village

00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:35.580
 and everyone's fucking going nuts

00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:37.980
 'cause it's just running around, freaking out.

00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:39.260
 - Have you ever actually like seen a tiger?

00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:40.780
 - Yeah, there's big.

00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:41.620
 - Yeah.

00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:42.740
 - Why was it a zoo?

00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:45.220
 There's either DC or New Orleans, one of the two.

00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:47.820
 But I'm sitting there and I had recently found out

00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:51.460
 that like tiger attacks are still very much a thing in India.

00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:52.300
 - Yeah.

00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:53.900
 - So I'm like, oh there's this tiger over here, right?

00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:55.980
 And like lions, lions are kind of bitch-like compared

00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:58.020
 to like what they're like, you know, all the fucking lions.

00:48:58.020 --> 00:48:59.780
 Like you see lions and you're like, okay.

00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:00.620
 (laughing)

00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:03.540
 But when I were by the tiger cage, right?

00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:06.260
 And this shit was like, it just made like a noise.

00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:09.820
 Like like a, the guttural thing, yeah, it's crazy.

00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:12.500
 Fucking here dude, I'm like, that is like,

00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:13.420
 that's like one of the scariest things

00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:15.340
 I've ever heard in my life, that that exists.

00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:16.620
 - Yeah.

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:18.540
 - Like, could you imagine you're just like chilling, right?

00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:19.540
 And you hear that?

00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:20.540
 - No, you're fucked.

00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:23.500
 - Like this massive monster of a cat.

00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:24.340
 It's terrifying.

00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:26.260
 - Have you seen that video with a guy in the elephant?

00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:27.100
 - Uh-huh, no.

00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:27.940
 (laughing)

00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:31.420
 - Okay, there's a guy riding an elephant.

00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:34.100
 The video is like from some guy sitting behind him.

00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:37.340
 So they're on the elephant and they're walking through

00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:39.900
 a field with like kind of high grass.

00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:42.620
 And then you see something moving in the grass

00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:47.300
 and the tiger jumps up, up, like onto the elephant

00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:49.700
 and like swipes his arm and like he gets injured

00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:50.940
 and then it like, it runs away.

00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:54.180
 It like jumped his eyes and elephant to fuck with him.

00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:55.020
 - Jeez.

00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:55.860
 - I don't know what you did.

00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:57.020
 You can't climb trees, they can climb trees.

00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:58.540
 - Yeah, you can't, you're screwed.

00:49:58.540 --> 00:49:59.380
 - That's it.

00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:00.220
 - So I need houses.

00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:01.060
 - Scary.

00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:02.820
 - We figured out how to build shelter.

00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:03.660
 (laughing)

00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:05.060
 - You have doors and locks.

00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:07.060
 (laughing)

00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:07.900
 - Yeah.

00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:09.300
 - Something got loose in New Jersey pretty recently.

00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:10.580
 - Was it a bear?

00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:11.940
 - The bears in New Jersey aren't really like.

00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:13.500
 - There's always, there's always bears.

00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:14.340
 No, it was like a.

00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:15.620
 - Yeah, they're not really like a threat.

00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:17.340
 - It was something cooler like a lion.

00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:18.220
 - Oh, like from a zoo?

00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:19.060
 - Yeah.

00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:20.260
 - You know, it's funny, I was looking at this thing.

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:22.180
 Like, I like, you know, have you ever gotten

00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:23.100
 to like the beach or a key place

00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:25.140
 and they have like all like the exotic meats.

00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:25.980
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:28.420
 - Alligator, rattlesnake and everything like that.

00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:29.260
 - So I like that.

00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:32.060
 There was just like a, there was this bar in New Brunswick,

00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:36.900
 right, that had like a, like a speakeasy meat restaurant.

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:37.900
 - Oh, I know exactly what you're talking about.

00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:38.740
 - Yeah.

00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:40.300
 - It's like a cross from the courthouse.

00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:42.140
 - I think it, I know what you're talking about, yeah.

00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:43.140
 Clides, yeah, exactly.

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:44.420
 - Yeah, it's going there and then you get like rattlesnake

00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:45.260
 and this is and that.

00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:46.100
 So like, I got like into it.

00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:46.940
 - Yeah, ostrich.

00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:48.260
 - I was like, oh man, I gotta like see what,

00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:51.220
 like what's like the, the max on this, right?

00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:54.720
 So there was a company in Florida selling lion tacos.

00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:55.980
 - Lion?

00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:56.820
 - Yeah.

00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:57.660
 - What?

00:50:57.660 --> 00:50:58.980
 - Are you supposed to eat predators though?

00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:00.180
 Isn't that like a whole?

00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:01.020
 - I don't know.

00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:01.860
 They got shut down.

00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:02.700
 - They're making me sketch.

00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:04.500
 - The whole thing got shut down.

00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:05.580
 That makes sense.

00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:06.420
 - Geez.

00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:07.260
 - Look at this shit.

00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:08.100
 Look at this shit.

00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:09.180
 My big ass head fucking.

00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:11.300
 (laughing)

00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:16.140
 - I'm telling you the, this is why I don't wear normal headphones.

00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:18.380
 When you shave your head, headphones just don't look,

00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:19.740
 look as good.

00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:20.900
 - I'm gonna get like a hedge.

00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:22.260
 Have you seen that, the headphone range?

00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:23.100
 - Oh yeah.

00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:24.420
 (laughing)

00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:26.740
 - Oh yeah, like dents in the head?

00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:27.580
 - Yeah.

00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:28.540
 - That's crazy.

00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:29.620
 That's what we are today.

00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:30.940
 They used to like run from lions

00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:33.080
 and now we're like, I'm gonna head up on my head.

00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:35.820
 (laughing)

00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:36.660
 - Oh yeah.

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:38.580
 - The finger hurts from ordering my Uber Eats.

00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:42.940
 Whenever you read like old stories and writings and shit,

00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:44.980
 they're like so dramatic that it seems like corny

00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:46.340
 if you were to do it today.

00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:48.980
 I think a lot of the reason is like shit like that, right?

00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:50.500
 Because it literally was dramatic.

00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:51.340
 - Mm.

00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:53.300
 (laughing)

00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:54.300
 - Yeah.

00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:56.460
 On the flip side though, like sometimes you read

00:51:56.460 --> 00:51:59.780
 like older philosophy books and stuff.

00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:02.740
 It's crazy how modern their problems feel.

00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:04.660
 Like they just talk about a lot of the same shit

00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:08.140
 that we talk about, but like, you know, 2000 years ago.

00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:10.020
 It's like the same shit that we deal with today.

00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:12.540
 And what's crazier is they like figured out

00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:16.100
 all that shit back then when like life was a lot harder.

00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:17.980
 Like when do they have the time to do this?

00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:21.700
 I think about our like, like the founding fathers of America.

00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:22.900
 These people were insane.

00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:26.220
 Like they, you know, grew up in the 1700s,

00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:29.380
 which is like a crazy time to live like nothing modern.

00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:34.380
 They fought a war, which is crazy, like just fighting a war.

00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:37.460
 Then they like understood enough about like government

00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:38.500
 and philosophy.

00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:42.460
 And like they understood like how ancient Greece worked

00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:45.380
 and like God, inspiration, like they knew all this stuff

00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:47.380
 and they created a constitution.

00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:48.660
 Like how do they do all of this?

00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:49.820
 - And they were like 24 at the time.

00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:50.740
 - In one life.

00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:52.380
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:54.020
 - Except for Ben Frank.

00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:54.860
 Who was just like.

00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:55.680
 - Oh, he was a weirdo.

00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:56.500
 - Oh, he was a weirdo.

00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:57.340
 - He was a dick suck.

00:52:57.340 --> 00:52:58.180
 He was fucking awesome.

00:52:58.180 --> 00:53:00.540
 (laughing)

00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:01.380
 What a guy.

00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:03.060
 What a guy.

00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:05.980
 - Dude, can you imagine being such a fucking pimp

00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:07.780
 that fucking you weren't a president

00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:09.140
 and just put on the money?

00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:11.100
 (laughing)

00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:15.020
 Like the best money to this guy is like a bunch.

00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:16.380
 - That guy's the man.

00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:18.640
 (laughing)

00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:22.020
 That's how we probably proposed it and some music.

00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:22.860
 Wait, hold on a second.

00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:24.420
 Shut the fuck up, like.

00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:26.300
 (laughing)

00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:27.780
 - We're not discussing this.

00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:31.140
 - Well, you know, the reason why is 'cause

00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:32.620
 they didn't have TikTok.

00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:33.820
 - Dude, well, if it gets banned,

00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:36.140
 I feel we're gonna have a productivity boost.

00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:38.100
 - Yeah, I mean, they didn't have the phone.

00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:41.100
 They didn't have the bread and circus.

00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:43.660
 All the, you know, it was like, for fun,

00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:44.940
 they would go like read books.

00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:47.340
 Like they couldn't wait to get their hands on a book.

00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:48.340
 (laughing)

00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:49.260
 - That's true, yeah.

00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:50.460
 - They're like a fucking chemistry textbook.

00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:53.820
 I'm gonna lock myself up and fucking read it by candlelight.

00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:56.540
 And it's gonna be the best.

00:53:56.540 --> 00:53:58.860
 (laughing)

00:53:58.860 --> 00:53:59.700
 That's all you had to think.

00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:00.540
 It was like that or like what?

00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:02.900
 Do you remember, like, everyone here is old enough

00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:04.580
 to remember like pre-cell phone.

00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:06.580
 Like, you remember like waiting for a ride

00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:09.420
 after like football practice without a cell phone?

00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:11.420
 Like you're just sitting there on a curb, you're like.

00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:12.260
 - Yeah.

00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:13.980
 - You're like fucking ripping grass apart,

00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:15.660
 like fucking throwing rocks at the airport.

00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:16.500
 (laughing)

00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:18.420
 You didn't fucking have anything to do.

00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:20.420
 You could just sit there and think about all this shit, right?

00:54:20.420 --> 00:54:21.940
 You're like, oh man.

00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:22.780
 It's kind of crazy.

00:54:22.780 --> 00:54:24.740
 Like the thing that you put on hot dogs

00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:26.220
 is called condiments.

00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:28.460
 (laughing)

00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:31.900
 You know, like you have time to think about things like that.

00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:36.060
 And then, now you know, I don't wonder about that.

00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:38.100
 'Cause like, when you go anywhere and there's a line,

00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:39.300
 it's everyone's on their phone.

00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:42.540
 And then you imagine like, what was this like 20 years ago?

00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:43.820
 Or like, you know, it was like 10 years ago.

00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:45.420
 - There's no either anytime.

00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:48.180
 There's no time where your brain is idle anymore, right?

00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:49.940
 Like it's always, always active,

00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:53.700
 always being fed something, like dopamine or whatever.

00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:54.980
 - That's why I like, actually never,

00:54:54.980 --> 00:54:57.100
 I've never gotten the habit of taking headphones

00:54:57.100 --> 00:54:58.700
 when I go anywhere.

00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:01.540
 Like I don't listen to anything when I'm walking or anything.

00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:02.380
 - I don't.

00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:03.220
 - So like, really?

00:55:03.220 --> 00:55:04.500
 - That's your situational awareness.

00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:05.900
 - I listen to books.

00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:08.260
 Wait, situational awareness, like you need to not be listening.

00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:10.700
 So if somebody like comes up on you or something.

00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:11.540
 - Yeah.

00:55:11.540 --> 00:55:12.380
 - 'Cause I don't have to worry about that in the other arts.

00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:13.220
 So maybe that's why.

00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:14.060
 - Yeah, I know.

00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:14.900
 I don't like that shit.

00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:16.220
 Like if I'm walking through like the city or something,

00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:18.180
 I don't put headphones on, I want to know what's going on.

00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:20.100
 Same thing, that's like another thing with like parenting.

00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:22.140
 Like I have like, Oculus and shit like that.

00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:24.620
 And it's like really difficult to like, immerse into that.

00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:28.140
 Because I have like, like pending responsibilities.

00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:28.980
 - Yeah.

00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:29.820
 - Right?

00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:33.580
 Like I have headphones on 'cause it's like, oh, like what if something happens upstairs?

00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:36.940
 Like a kid gets hurt or you know, like my wife like falls off of a chair or something.

00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:41.140
 Like I don't like the idea of that.

00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:43.540
 - I feel like a jerk for listening to music while I work.

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:44.540
 So.

00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:46.380
 - Well, you don't care about your family.

00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:47.380
 - No, that's cool.

00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:48.380
 - Yeah, I guess not.

00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:49.380
 - That's cool.

00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:50.380
 - That's cool.

00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:54.460
 You know, like you'll go somewhere and like, or like a plane doesn't have Wi-Fi.

00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:55.460
 - Oh.

00:55:55.460 --> 00:55:56.460
 - You know?

00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:57.460
 - Yeah.

00:55:57.460 --> 00:56:06.580
 - I feel like actual anxiety when, like I don't know that if I need to be reached, I could

00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:07.580
 be reached.

00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:08.580
 - Yeah.

00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:10.500
 You don't know like what pending news is happening.

00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:11.500
 - Exactly.

00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:12.500
 I'll be like on like an airplane, right?

00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:13.500
 And there's no Wi-Fi.

00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:14.500
 I'm like, oh my God.

00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:17.900
 Like, like I could be getting like canceled on Twitter right now and I would have no idea.

00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:25.580
 And I would like land and then like, and like, like right there to defend yourself.

00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:29.580
 - Yeah, that happens to me by accident sometimes where I'm like actually enjoying my life.

00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:32.500
 And I like leave my phone somewhere and I forget about it for hours.

00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:35.100
 Then I remember, I'm like, fuck, there's definitely something bad.

00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:40.380
 And I go and I like feel so relieved when there's like nothing.

00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:42.380
 It's weird.

00:56:42.380 --> 00:56:50.100
 - If you make yourself uncontactable for like six to eight hours, somebody's going to have

00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:51.100
 a problem with it.

00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:52.100
 - Oh yeah.

00:56:52.100 --> 00:56:53.100
 I mean, my wife.

00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:54.100
 - I'll tell you a funny story.

00:56:54.100 --> 00:57:01.860
 I was at React Miami and I land and I get there and, you know, everyone's like in the

00:57:01.860 --> 00:57:04.100
 hot tub and the pool area hanging out.

00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:05.100
 I'm like, ah, what's going on?

00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:10.180
 So I like, you know, two hours later, I have like the bartenders making like the drink,

00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:11.180
 my signature drink.

00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:12.180
 I'm like, yeah.

00:57:12.180 --> 00:57:16.420
 So I was like white wine and a little triple sec and did it, she's fucking house, right?

00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:17.420
 So I'm like, all right, guys, all right.

00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:21.060
 I'm going to go take a shower and then, you know, we can meet up with a speaker dinner

00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:22.060
 or whatever.

00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:25.140
 So I go up and I'm like, you know, classic me.

00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:26.980
 I tell you what, I say it's late on for one second.

00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:29.980
 That was a lot, you know, I'm fucking wake up.

00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:31.900
 It's like one in the morning.

00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:36.020
 I get just like a billion missed calls for my wife.

00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:38.820
 She's like, what the fuck?

00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:39.820
 I call her.

00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:42.180
 I'm like, hey, she's like, what's going on?

00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:43.420
 I'm like, you're not going to believe this.

00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:44.980
 I literally fell asleep.

00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:50.860
 And like, she like, believe like, she's like, you know, she wasn't like, you're, you're

00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:56.300
 lying about this, you know, but it was just so weird for me to like not be contactable

00:57:56.300 --> 00:57:59.740
 that she was like, yeah, he's like dead or in jail or something.

00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:00.740
 Yeah.

00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:03.780
 What was, yeah, what was business travel like, like 30 years ago when people didn't ask

00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:04.780
 themselves.

00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:05.780
 I thought it was probably awesome.

00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:13.820
 You could like smoke cigarettes and shit and arrest, that's, that's how I'm, that's how

00:58:13.820 --> 00:58:21.100
 I'm imagining it went, yeah, like real silverware and you're like, you can whiskey use it.

00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:22.100
 Yeah.

00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:25.500
 I don't know how any of this stuff happened because when I lived in New York, I'd always

00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:27.580
 like go and meet up with my friends.

00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:30.420
 And we would like literally have our location shared.

00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:34.500
 So we knew that like, okay, he's going to be here in a couple minutes, like imagine going

00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:38.500
 to meet up with someone to dinner and they just don't show up and you're like, are they

00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:39.500
 dead?

00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:40.500
 Like, should I wait?

00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:41.740
 Like, what the fuck do I do?

00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:44.460
 I just feel like doing anything seems impossible, like coordinating anything.

00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:49.260
 Back at the day, I remember dude, we used to sit there and like, like we would hang out

00:58:49.260 --> 00:58:50.260
 at the boardwalk, 7-11.

00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:51.260
 Right.

00:58:51.260 --> 00:58:53.180
 There's a 7-11 right across from the boardwalk.

00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:56.060
 We just like hang out on this bike rack, right.

00:58:56.060 --> 00:58:59.420
 And like, that's just, like, I, like, I'd leave my house and I'd be like, let me go

00:58:59.420 --> 00:59:00.420
 self.

00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:01.420
 Right.

00:59:01.420 --> 00:59:02.420
 Like over there.

00:59:02.420 --> 00:59:05.020
 And then maybe on the bike rack, I'm like, Hey, yeah, I'd put this up on the bike rack

00:59:05.020 --> 00:59:08.620
 and like, like you'd have like this, but like we didn't have cell phones or anything like

00:59:08.620 --> 00:59:09.620
 that.

00:59:09.620 --> 00:59:10.620
 And I remember like, there was this girl, right?

00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:13.500
 She wasn't, she didn't live in the town.

00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:16.340
 She just like came for the summer, sort of, right.

00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:19.540
 So like, we didn't know her that well, but we knew her well enough and, you know, like

00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:21.340
 I, like finally kind of locked it in.

00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:22.340
 Right.

00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:24.900
 It was kind of like established that something might go down.

00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:26.980
 And this was like young dude, it was like 12.

00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:27.980
 Right.

00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:32.780
 So it's not like, so like, she had to go and like I had to go because it was like curfews

00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:33.780
 or whatever.

00:59:33.780 --> 00:59:34.780
 And I'm like, curfews.

00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:35.780
 I'm like, all right.

00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:36.780
 Yo, what are you doing tomorrow?

00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:38.420
 And she's like, she's like, I'll be out.

00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:39.420
 She's like, come find me.

00:59:39.420 --> 00:59:40.420
 Right.

00:59:40.420 --> 00:59:45.420
 So then like, you're sitting there and like, like 12, 13 years old, pussy-brained.

00:59:45.420 --> 00:59:46.420
 Right.

00:59:46.420 --> 00:59:51.980
 Like fucking out there on the bike rack, you know, people roll up like, oh, you see, you

00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:52.980
 see Annie?

00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:58.420
 You know, like, and, you know, like, no, we didn't, I'm like, what the fuck is she?

00:59:58.420 --> 00:59:59.420
 Right.

00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:04.020
 Like, yeah, I want to go ride my bike and see, she's out and about, right?

01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:05.020
 Yeah.

01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:07.020
 I'm like, I didn't find it.

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:08.020
 Oh, no.

01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:13.540
 But yeah, yeah, that's what it was like.

01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:17.940
 Stuff was more, you know, when you described that, I was like, oh, yeah, that is, now I

01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:18.940
 can remember what it was like.

01:00:18.940 --> 01:00:21.420
 There's random shit would happen like that all the time and it would feel really good

01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:22.420
 when it worked out.

01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:23.420
 Yeah.

01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:24.420
 Cause it was random, entirely out of your control.

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:27.420
 Each other, you'd be like, Hey, what's up?

01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:28.420
 Link up.

01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:30.420
 You're only like calling people's houses.

01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:31.420
 Oh, yeah.

01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:34.220
 The time is rad is dark there.

01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:35.220
 Exactly.

01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:41.820
 So you give your parents pick up for you, yeah, not for you.

01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:43.220
 You call a girl's house.

01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:47.220
 You're like, may I please speak with me?

01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:51.260
 I, uh, I need help with my homework or like, I forgot my, my worksheet.

01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:57.100
 Are you like, I remember like, like, also pre cell phone, like, they're, like, you'd

01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:59.700
 have like the court, like it wasn't just the one kitchen phone.

01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:02.500
 Like, we evolved to have the multiple cordless phones.

01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:03.500
 Yeah.

01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:04.500
 Right.

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:07.460
 Like, like talking to some girl, like, I know what you did.

01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:08.460
 No, no, no.

01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:09.460
 You suck the dick.

01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:10.460
 Right?

01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:13.260
 And it's like, like, you hear like the cordless phone click off.

01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:15.260
 Somebody was listening.

01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:16.260
 Yeah.

01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:22.180
 Like motherfucker, there was like no expectation of privacy whatsoever.

01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:27.700
 Man, I can't believe, like, I can't believe we lived through that.

01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:33.580
 That feels like a different, different time, there's like adults who have no concept of

01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:34.580
 what that was like.

01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:35.580
 Yeah.

01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:36.580
 That's true.

01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:39.460
 Like people who, there's some people in their twenties right now who like never experienced

01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:40.460
 any of that.

01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:41.460
 Yeah.

01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:45.100
 And they were born like in the year 2001, which is insane that people were born.

01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:46.100
 Yeah.

01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:47.100
 Then.

01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:48.100
 Yeah.

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:51.340
 It's fucking crazy business, man.

01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:52.340
 Yeah.

01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:59.060
 I'm glad I grew up and I'll, yeah, like when we did, it's just, I felt like it was just

01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:01.460
 like childhood was like so much simpler and straightforward.

01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:03.900
 I love my, I love growing up, just everything about it.

01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:04.900
 It was great.

01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:07.940
 I wonder if childhood was, was simpler.

01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:09.580
 I wonder if the kids now, right?

01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:13.100
 Like, like tech aside will have the same thing, just because it's childhood, or because it

01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:14.100
 actually was.

01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:15.100
 Yeah.

01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:19.500
 It's hard to say the nostalgia and like just not having responsibilities and all that.

01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:24.940
 But my days were straightforward as fuck, like I just did the same thing every single

01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:25.940
 day.

01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:26.940
 Yeah.

01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:32.700
 And prior to that, for a good portion there, like kids could just go out and be out and

01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:33.700
 about.

01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:34.700
 Yeah.

01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:35.700
 Go outside.

01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:36.700
 That's what I grew up with.

01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:37.700
 That was normal.

01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:38.700
 Yeah.

01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:39.700
 Yeah.

01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:40.700
 But that's like super not normal.

01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:41.700
 Yeah, exactly.

01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:42.700
 That's what I'm talking about.

01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:46.020
 Like it's, it's like, and even as an adult, I feel like there's this thing that happened.

01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:47.020
 I don't know.

01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:48.020
 I mean, let's talk about this.

01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:49.260
 Like I don't know if it's like a post COVID thing.

01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:53.020
 Like, I feel like no one just hangs out, at least for us, like in our circles, no one

01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:58.660
 just hangs out randomly, it's like you have to like schedule a formal meeting, like two

01:02:58.660 --> 01:02:59.660
 weeks in advance.

01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:02.140
 It's a big plant dinner for exactly two hours.

01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:05.420
 And just like, I just don't, that just is a different thing.

01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:08.180
 Like it doesn't, I feel like we lost something.

01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:09.300
 It's a big schedule thing.

01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:10.300
 Yeah.

01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:14.460
 I don't know if that's just part of getting older, but it's just different than how we

01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:15.460
 so operate.

01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:19.420
 Like I would just like get done with the work and then just like randomly go meet up with

01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:21.020
 one of my friends like all the time.

01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:23.300
 And that just is not a thing that happens as much anymore.

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:25.500
 Did your friends have kids?

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:27.180
 My friends don't have kids now.

01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:30.700
 And it's still kind of like after COVID, I feel like everything turned into like more

01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:31.700
 of a plan.

01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:32.700
 Kids is like a big thing.

01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:33.700
 Like schedule wise.

01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:34.700
 Yeah.

01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:35.700
 Like, like, you know, my boys will be like, yeah.

01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:36.700
 I get that.

01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:39.140
 Oh, we're all going to go fucking do this at Buffalo Wild Wings.

01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:43.740
 And I'm like, I'm like, yeah, I'm going to go to Buffalo Wild Wings on a fucking Tuesday

01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:44.740
 night.

01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:45.740
 I'll be fine.

01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:51.540
 I'll never hear the end of it.

01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:55.220
 No, but like even with our friends that don't have kids, I feel like we forgot how to just

01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:58.900
 randomly casually hang out.

01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:00.860
 It just ended up having to be like this formal plan.

01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:03.540
 You definitely don't pop over anybody else's place anymore.

01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:04.540
 Yeah.

01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:05.540
 We're used to it.

01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:06.540
 It's like, yeah.

01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:07.540
 And that was great.

01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:08.540
 I loved it.

01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:09.540
 And I would love it now.

01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:11.180
 Like if someone did that right now, I had no problem with it.

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:13.380
 We actually have a neighbor that kind of does that.

01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:16.060
 It's a nice, but it's not normal.

01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:22.020
 If somebody like just like pulled up like midday and was like, what are you doing right

01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:23.020
 now?

01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:24.020
 I didn't have anything going on.

01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:25.020
 Like, that'd be like the best thing.

01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:26.020
 I'd be like, oh, yeah.

01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:27.020
 Yeah.

01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:28.020
 It's got a bottle of the fuck.

01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:29.020
 Dude, don't shit.

01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:30.020
 Yeah.

01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:31.020
 It'd be amazing.

01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:32.020
 We should show up at Adam's house.

01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:33.020
 I don't really.

01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:34.260
 I don't really do the hanging out thing.

01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:37.780
 I thought it was just because we had kids and now we just don't prioritize any kind of

01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:39.340
 social life.

01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:41.100
 But maybe it's just our personalities.

01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:44.780
 So I think, so we don't just like hang out with people, right?

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:48.460
 We can just like fucking hang out with like, I don't have like, you know, I know, I know

01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:52.140
 people who do like have like, you know, the kind of guys who like go to like all their

01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:57.260
 friends, like, like, like wedding, all their college friends weddings, you know, like,

01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:58.260
 Oh, it's wedding.

01:04:58.260 --> 01:04:59.260
 She's you go to these weddings.

01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:01.220
 Well, these people are fucking like really close.

01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:03.260
 Like I don't have any of that.

01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:04.260
 Yeah.

01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:05.260
 I mean, like that.

01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:09.100
 But, you know, there's people that do, like, oh, my best buds for life is fucking college

01:05:09.100 --> 01:05:10.100
 people and shit.

01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:11.100
 Yeah.

01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:16.780
 But I think that if you find people, especially with kids, right, like if you, if you find

01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:21.220
 people that are like the same kind of people as you, hanging out with them is a lot of

01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:22.220
 fun.

01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:23.220
 We had.

01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:28.100
 So that's yeah, that's the problem that we don't know anybody like in the area.

01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:29.100
 We're pretty different.

01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:30.100
 Yeah.

01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:37.260
 I mean, we live in a very like, like a very mono culture, like the Ozarks are a certain

01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:38.260
 thing.

01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:39.540
 And we're very different from that thing.

01:05:39.540 --> 01:05:42.220
 So there's really not like a lot of overlap.

01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:45.820
 We've never really found people that we felt like we connected with here.

01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:46.820
 This just got depressing.

01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:47.820
 I'm sorry.

01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:48.820
 Yeah.

01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:52.780
 Well, I mean, we had the people around the same page, like they had like kids and like

01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:57.940
 to fucking just like chill and drink white claws in the pool and chip and they moved.

01:05:57.940 --> 01:05:59.420
 Oh, that's a worse heartbreaking.

01:05:59.420 --> 01:06:00.420
 Yeah.

01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:02.980
 I was like, ah, damn it.

01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:03.980
 Yeah.

01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:07.860
 Because like the other like there's there's people we can hang out with, but it's not

01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:08.860
 really same page.

01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:09.860
 Yeah.

01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:10.860
 Where you're just yourselves.

01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:15.220
 Like, I've definitely experienced that in life, like the difference between like people

01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:17.740
 that you could have over, but you're kind of just like ready for it to be over from

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:18.740
 the beginning.

01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:20.600
 Like you just don't really want to sit down and do the dinner thing.

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:24.140
 It's just the whole thing is kind of like less comfortable than your normal life.

01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:25.140
 Yeah.

01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:29.060
 And then there's people that you can just be yourself, you know what I mean, like, like

01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:30.060
 why are we even doing this?

01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:31.460
 Do you guys even want to be here?

01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:32.460
 Like do we want you to be here?

01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:33.860
 No, this is kind of stupid.

01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:35.500
 Like we've definitely done that.

01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:37.300
 I do have some contenders though.

01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:41.300
 And at the moment, and people that might be that.

01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:46.500
 So you end up meeting like your kids, school friends parents.

01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:48.300
 And sometimes sometimes they're cool.

01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:52.220
 A lot of the times they're like, that's great when you have kids that they're a little networking

01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:53.220
 boss.

01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:54.220
 Yeah.

01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:57.180
 Not like if you meet people who are like, you know, cut from the same cloth or generally

01:06:57.180 --> 01:07:01.280
 in the same page, like that works out, you know, like I've chilled with a couple of parents

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:04.620
 that like, they're like, I have like a play date and they'll be like, Oh, well, yeah, you

01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:05.620
 guys come over too.

01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:06.620
 We'll do dinner or some shit, right?

01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:07.620
 Cool.

01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:10.620
 And then there's other ones where it's like completely different.

01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:17.020
 They'll go to like birthday parties where we're like, like a lot of like the parents

01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:18.020
 are older.

01:07:18.020 --> 01:07:19.020
 Okay.

01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:20.020
 In this particular area.

01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:21.020
 Right.

01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:24.420
 So like I roll up and like fucking like this, right?

01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:30.380
 And these guys are more of like the like the on clouds and the quarter zip fleece.

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:36.420
 You know, like the closest thing I've got now to like.

01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:40.100
 Like a burgeoning social life is just the people at my jujitsu gym.

01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:41.900
 I do feel like there's a certain bond.

01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:42.900
 That is the best.

01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:43.900
 It really is.

01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:46.580
 Like I have nothing else in common with most of them, but just that's enough.

01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:48.980
 It's like we have this thing in common.

01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:52.700
 And I do see, I could like see some of those things turning into friendships that I actually

01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:54.100
 have you party with them yet?

01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:57.140
 No, they did a Christmas party and I wasn't able to make it.

01:07:57.140 --> 01:07:59.060
 That's the closest thing that would have happened.

01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:04.180
 I got a lot of good friends from from martial arts.

01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:05.180
 Tons.

01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:06.180
 Everything experience.

01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:10.020
 I mean, it's kind of hard not to get out of how you got to have like gym outings.

01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:12.420
 I can't believe we haven't talked about jujitsu.

01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:13.420
 It's great.

01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:15.780
 I had no idea you were into jujitsu.

01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:18.900
 Like you've been doing it for a while.

01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:22.180
 Somehow I haven't been doing it for a while.

01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:24.940
 Or you haven't been doing it for you just I mean like you've been doing it long enough

01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:27.980
 to be your your late blue belt.

01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:30.580
 That's you've been doing it for a little while.

01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:32.780
 Can't believe I've never heard you talk about it on Twitter or something.

01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:33.780
 I don't know.

01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:41.900
 I like like I did it like very very aggressively.

01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:45.260
 And then after kids it like tapered off.

01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:54.700
 I've gone back like a few times, but yeah, not not recently, but yeah, how much fun is

01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:55.700
 that?

01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:56.700
 It's so much fun.

01:08:56.700 --> 01:08:57.700
 It's the best.

01:08:57.700 --> 01:08:58.700
 They actually got to do it.

01:08:58.700 --> 01:08:59.700
 Got to give it a shot.

01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:00.700
 It's really quite a bit of fun.

01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:03.740
 It's kind of a hard thing to just give a shot like you just go once or twice and you're

01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:04.740
 just going to be in pain.

01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:05.740
 Your hands are going to hurt.

01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:06.900
 And you're going to be like, why did I do that?

01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:11.140
 You kind of have to like go all in for a while and then give it a real shot, but it does

01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:12.140
 have implications.

01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:13.140
 Very chest like.

01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:16.700
 It's so yeah, the cerebral side of it.

01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:17.700
 Yeah.

01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:18.700
 Yeah.

01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:19.700
 For sure.

01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:22.300
 Like like like you're always trying to like if you actually want to land something like

01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:28.180
 you have to set it up like in advance and you also need to detect when they're setting

01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:29.180
 it up, right?

01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:31.460
 You're like like feeling the flow.

01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:33.100
 It's crazy.

01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:36.380
 And then it's also really exertion because like, you know, if you're like work all day

01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:40.620
 long and it's like regular like tech, well, not so much now poster, but like the pre-tech

01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:43.380
 was like really, really sensitive.

01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:45.780
 And then like you leave work and you just go to this gym and everybody's like calling

01:09:45.780 --> 01:09:47.300
 each other a bitch and posting.

01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:49.780
 There's like the best.

01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:50.780
 Yeah.

01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:51.780
 The contrast.

01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:52.780
 Yeah.

01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:57.780
 Is that what your gym is like Adam or people calling you a bitch?

01:09:57.780 --> 01:09:58.780
 No.

01:09:58.780 --> 01:09:59.780
 No.

01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:00.780
 It's midwestern.

01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:01.780
 Oh, it's midwestern.

01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:02.780
 No, it's just like.

01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:04.700
 Midwestern is a different culture.

01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:05.700
 Yeah.

01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:09.100
 I mean, it's just like people are different here.

01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:13.900
 We're all kind of like half fake all the time, just a little like shiny veneer in front

01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:14.900
 of everything we do.

01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:15.900
 Are you guys all robots?

01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:16.900
 What?

01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:20.780
 It's kind of like, yeah, I appreciate the East Coast like how you guys are, just how

01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:23.580
 raw and you just say what you think like I wish I could do that.

01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:24.580
 Why don't they do that?

01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:25.940
 I actually bothers me that they don't do that.

01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:27.580
 But people in the Midwest don't do that.

01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:28.580
 Yeah.

01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:29.580
 Yeah, no, me too.

01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:30.580
 I think it gets worse.

01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:35.220
 Southern California is probably the worst, right, in terms of fakeness and like pretend

01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:39.420
 like you like somebody or like your Seattle for them or you're not.

01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:40.420
 What is that?

01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:41.420
 Yeah.

01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:42.420
 I don't know what that is.

01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:43.500
 I don't know anything about the Northwest.

01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:44.500
 It's basically that.

01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:47.020
 So is it just everywhere except for the Northeast?

01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:48.420
 I think so.

01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:50.540
 I think the Northeast is unique and it's.

01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:54.940
 No, I think the South is like a a polite or Northeast.

01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:57.220
 Do you think people are straightforward in the South?

01:10:57.220 --> 01:10:58.220
 I think so.

01:10:58.220 --> 01:10:59.580
 I guess I don't know either way.

01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:01.340
 Yeah, I'm not sure.

01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:02.500
 Miami's its own thing.

01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:03.900
 Miami's not in the United States.

01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:08.020
 So it's like it's got its own vibe.

01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:09.580
 People are straightforward as fuck here.

01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:13.460
 I don't consider Florida at least the bottom half of Florida the South.

01:11:13.460 --> 01:11:16.540
 Yeah, no, it's it's it's different.

01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:22.300
 But people are here are like really straightforward, but that's more of like the the Latin side

01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:23.300
 of things.

01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:30.340
 Like also like Florida is at least 65% people who came there from New York.

01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:31.580
 Yeah, that's true.

01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:32.580
 It's funny.

01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:38.740
 So speaking of like, you know, getting to know people that you click with, so we moved

01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:43.180
 to our old houses available and we're like really keeping an eye on who moves in there

01:11:43.180 --> 01:11:46.020
 because we're hoping that the people that we let the show look because it'll be amazing

01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:49.660
 if you're like cool with your neighbors like that.

01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:52.740
 Every single person that has looked at it has been from New York.

01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:53.740
 Very single one.

01:11:53.740 --> 01:11:54.740
 It's really crazy.

01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:55.740
 Huh.

01:11:55.740 --> 01:12:02.580
 There was actually one that wasn't, but she was from San Francisco, so yeah, everyone moves

01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:03.580
 here.

01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:04.580
 It's crazy.

01:12:04.580 --> 01:12:10.100
 Is it still it's still heated up or is it cool down a little the market?

01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:13.060
 I think it's it's definitely not continuing to increase.

01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:19.020
 I don't know if stuff has gone down that much, maybe a little bit, but it's not like going

01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:21.300
 up anymore, which is which is good.

01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:22.300
 That is good.

01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:23.300
 It's fucking everything up.

01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:24.300
 Like, I don't know.

01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:26.940
 It's just the prices haven't matched those yet.

01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:33.760
 I feel like the problem, the biggest problem is that unlike many places, like you have

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:40.460
 Miami and like normally I'd be like, Oh, go look fucking like, you know, 30 minutes west,

01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:45.100
 but like 30 minutes west is a fucking giant swamp, right?

01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:51.940
 Like like like 75% of that whole area is just swamp.

01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:56.260
 Like you don't have the opportunity to really like, you know, it's not like, you know, like

01:12:56.260 --> 01:12:59.740
 like Atlanta has like suburbs, excerpts.

01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:06.860
 So I actually don't think what I think what's maybe not obvious is the city city part of

01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:10.940
 Miami is pretty small and most of Miami is actually suburb.

01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:16.580
 So there actually is a lot of opportunity to live like within a 30 minute range of like

01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:20.620
 the coastal, like the city is directly on the coast of the downtown area.

01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:27.380
 And there's like a huge range of like options there, like in terms of like price, but it's

01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:29.540
 only north or south for the most part.

01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:36.140
 No, I think so there's about like, if you drive from the coast, if you like, say, if

01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:41.900
 you drive west, there's about an hour of driving before you hit the end of the development.

01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:42.900
 Really?

01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:45.780
 Like the swamp starts and they've been actually like building into that.

01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:51.780
 So Liz's parents live, they like moved to the edge at the time, which was like 10 or

01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:53.300
 15 years ago.

01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:56.140
 And that was like them like cutting down the swamp and like building houses there.

01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:57.140
 And they're continuing to go.

01:13:57.140 --> 01:13:59.540
 And now the edge is shifted, shifted a little bit further.

01:13:59.540 --> 01:14:01.860
 So it's like Kendall, sweet water.

01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:02.860
 This is like an hour.

01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:05.220
 I think Kendall's further south, right?

01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:06.220
 Yeah.

01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:07.220
 Oh, yeah.

01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:08.220
 Sweet water.

01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:09.220
 Yeah.

01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:11.180
 So she's from yeah, Kendall, exactly.

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:15.860
 That's like 45 minutes to an hour from the coast.

01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:16.860
 Really?

01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:17.860
 Yeah.

01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:20.180
 So she's more from Miami Lakes, a little bit further north.

01:14:20.180 --> 01:14:25.300
 It's just because, I mean, it could, yeah, 45 minutes, I think is fair.

01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:30.100
 We live on the coast a little bit further south in coconut grove.

01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:33.100
 And that's like south of Coral Gables, which for some reason everyone knows about Coral

01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:34.100
 Gables.

01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:35.100
 I saw you like referencing it the other day.

01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:36.100
 I don't know.

01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:38.540
 Like everyone somehow knows that Coral Gables is a spot.

01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:41.220
 I'm like, oh, it's going to like fucking move.

01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:42.520
 It's like a joke to them.

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:47.140
 I'm like, I'm like, oh, well, yeah, I'd love to live in Miami and feel like, oh, you're

01:14:47.140 --> 01:14:48.140
 going to open the vongue.

01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:49.140
 Oh, sir.

01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:52.900
 Is that like, is that like where you need to go?

01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:53.900
 That's not actually the joke.

01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:56.980
 The joke is that if you live there, it's fucking nice.

01:14:56.980 --> 01:15:02.460
 Like it is like the, you get these beautiful, super well maintained like classic Spanish

01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:03.460
 mansions there.

01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:05.420
 So it's like my kind of suburbia.

01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:06.420
 Yeah.

01:15:06.420 --> 01:15:07.420
 You love it.

01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:08.420
 You fucking love it.

01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:10.100
 See at the moment, though, to be honest with you.

01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:11.100
 Yeah.

01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:16.380
 But that's like the highest end, unless you're like, if you're a normal person, that's like

01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:17.380
 the top.

01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:21.580
 Obviously you can go like absurd, like Jeff Bezos though here.

01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:26.100
 But if you're like a normal person, Coral Gables is like the top, but yeah, somehow everyone

01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:27.100
 it's a joke.

01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:28.100
 Should I move there?

01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:29.100
 And Joker, one knows about it.

01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:30.100
 Dude, I'd love it.

01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:31.100
 We'd be like 10 minutes away.

01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:36.540
 And I'll just stop by your house randomly and you're like, fuck, I regret everything I

01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:41.900
 said.

01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:42.900
 Not every day.

01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:43.900
 Give me some time to work.

01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:46.380
 But fucking guy really got me in the alcohol and shit.

01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:50.540
 I'm not like a jiu jitsu geek.

01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:55.180
 Do you wash your every day every time?

01:15:55.180 --> 01:15:56.180
 Every every time.

01:15:56.180 --> 01:15:57.180
 Yeah.

01:15:57.180 --> 01:15:58.180
 I got a bunch.

01:15:58.180 --> 01:15:59.180
 Okay.

01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:00.180
 Just making sure.

01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:01.180
 I take a different one every time.

01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:02.180
 That's a good thing.

01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:03.180
 Yeah.

01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:04.180
 I wash my belt.

01:16:04.180 --> 01:16:07.940
 And have you gotten a skin infection yet?

01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:08.940
 You will.

01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:09.940
 No.

01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:10.940
 Yeah.

01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:11.940
 That was a thing.

01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:12.940
 You will.

01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:13.940
 You will.

01:16:13.940 --> 01:16:14.940
 I've heard.

01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:15.940
 Just run like other people sweat.

01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:16.940
 I got one in high school football.

01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:17.940
 I got staff.

01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:18.940
 Football.

01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:19.940
 Like it's kind of like weird shit.

01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:20.940
 Like a little rot going on.

01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:22.740
 That sounds disgusting.

01:16:22.740 --> 01:16:23.740
 Yeah.

01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:26.580
 Are you on like Advil and Tiger Bomb yet?

01:16:26.580 --> 01:16:27.580
 What?

01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:30.700
 Like Advil and Tiger Bomb, like your joints hurt.

01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:31.900
 My joints definitely hurt.

01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:32.900
 But what's Tiger Bomb?

01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:36.900
 It's like the shit that you put on your muscles and after shit and it like stings.

01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:38.380
 It's like Ben Gay?

01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:39.380
 Sort of.

01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:40.380
 Yeah.

01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:41.380
 Nah.

01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:42.380
 I do.

01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:45.220
 I take not Advil, but I take like turmeric supplements.

01:16:45.220 --> 01:16:46.220
 Yeah.

01:16:46.220 --> 01:16:47.220
 Turmeric.

01:16:47.220 --> 01:16:49.220
 I don't know how to say it.

01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:50.220
 I don't know how to say it.

01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:51.220
 Turmeric.

01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:52.220
 It helps.

01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:53.220
 It's like I be pro.

01:16:53.220 --> 01:16:55.540
 Like this holistic Advil and then.

01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:56.540
 It just less.

01:16:56.540 --> 01:16:57.540
 I have my own.

01:16:57.540 --> 01:17:03.700
 It's empty out of things frozen vegetables on top of a pizza and fucking jerk off a coconut

01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:04.700
 oil.

01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:05.700
 You.

01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:11.180
 Do you remember that picture that Adam posts any time Adam posts a picture of what he's

01:17:11.180 --> 01:17:12.180
 eating.

01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:13.180
 It just looks disgusting.

01:17:13.180 --> 01:17:14.180
 There was a couple.

01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:18.620
 There was a couple of times where it looked half decent and I was like, I need that.

01:17:18.620 --> 01:17:22.340
 There were some pizza you posted once and I was like, what the hell is this?

01:17:22.340 --> 01:17:24.340
 You posted some like pizza.

01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:25.340
 Are you vegan?

01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:26.340
 Or are you vegetarian?

01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:28.940
 We've been vegan for like 11 years in February.

01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:29.940
 Okay.

01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:30.940
 So you don't cheese.

01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:31.940
 No cheese.

01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:32.940
 Yeah.

01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:33.940
 No dairy.

01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:34.940
 I could maybe do.

01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:35.940
 Maybe.

01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:37.820
 Um, just cheese exists.

01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:40.740
 There's a lot of vegan cheeses.

01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:41.740
 They're probably really gross.

01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:42.740
 Yeah.

01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:43.740
 They're all in our fucking process and stuff.

01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:48.980
 We used to, um, I used to be by this, uh, it was, you know, there's, we used to go there

01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:49.980
 for lunch sometimes.

01:17:49.980 --> 01:17:50.980
 Right?

01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:53.180
 When I used to work in this like little New Jersey city, right?

01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:58.020
 And they'd have like, you know, a couple of places like that, like vegan spots.

01:17:58.020 --> 01:17:59.020
 Right.

01:17:59.020 --> 01:18:04.500
 And like there was like a pizza that was like cold and it was like crushed up nuts as cheese.

01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:05.500
 Yeah.

01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:10.260
 Like, I'm like, you know, it's fine for what it is, but it's not fucking pizza.

01:18:10.260 --> 01:18:11.260
 Yeah.

01:18:11.260 --> 01:18:12.260
 There's a different thing.

01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:15.660
 I do feel like vegan technology has gotten better.

01:18:15.660 --> 01:18:19.740
 I feel like some of them, there's a lot of other restaurants that are vegan are actually

01:18:19.740 --> 01:18:20.740
 pretty good.

01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:25.400
 One in my neighborhood that I keep saying this, I'm not going to cause I'm not going

01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:29.060
 to go to a vegan spot on my own, but if Adam is here, I'll go with him.

01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:30.060
 Everyone says amazing.

01:18:30.060 --> 01:18:35.060
 They have, um, oh, what does that, they, they make everything with it.

01:18:35.060 --> 01:18:36.060
 Tempe.

01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:37.060
 Tempe?

01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:38.060
 Oh, yeah.

01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:39.060
 Tempe.

01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:40.060
 Yeah.

01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:41.060
 Yeah.

01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:42.060
 Yeah.

01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:48.940
 So like there's a place by us where they have like vegan barbecue ribs and vegan chicken

01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:54.580
 sandwiches and shit like that, and yeah, it, it, it actually tastes like that food, but

01:18:54.580 --> 01:18:57.740
 I can't imagine that's good for you the way that they, they sent this down.

01:18:57.740 --> 01:18:58.740
 It never is.

01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:02.700
 When they try to make it, they just make good food on its own, whenever they try to make

01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:05.900
 it like other food, it's always like a bunch of bullshit.

01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:06.900
 Yeah.

01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:07.900
 Like the fake burgers and stuff.

01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:08.900
 Like, oh, the fake meat.

01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:12.540
 To me, like when they make really realistic fake meat, it's like, I don't know what their

01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:16.140
 market is because I, I'm not trying to like replace meat in my life.

01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:17.140
 I'm not missing.

01:19:17.140 --> 01:19:18.140
 You don't miss.

01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:23.380
 So that's not to me, we eat burgers like we eat plant-based burgers, not like the impossible

01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:24.380
 one so much.

01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:27.500
 No, what I'm saying is you don't miss actual burgers.

01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:28.500
 Not at all.

01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:29.500
 No.

01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:31.820
 I don't miss like really anything we used to eat.

01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:36.340
 There's something like a year in where you just kind of like adapt and it's just a very

01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:40.220
 different, like now the idea of dairy just kind of makes me sick, like the idea of it

01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:42.300
 in my body.

01:19:42.300 --> 01:19:47.740
 So it's not like a, like a willpower thing where it's like, man, what I'd do for a stick.

01:19:47.740 --> 01:19:48.900
 You just kind of like lose taste for it.

01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:52.140
 Is that true for everyone that's vegan or do you think that's specific to me?

01:19:52.140 --> 01:19:56.820
 I think if you are for a while, I think it'd be hard to still want those foods.

01:19:56.820 --> 01:20:02.180
 I can't fathom like at some point looking at a picture of a steak and not feeling anything.

01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:03.180
 Not feeling anything.

01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:05.260
 Do you know my favorite thing to do in the entire world is?

01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:06.260
 Do we want to know?

01:20:06.260 --> 01:20:07.260
 I have some guesses.

01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:09.900
 Get my vegan friends all fucked up and get them.

01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:10.900
 [laughter]

01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:17.900
 [laughter]

01:20:17.900 --> 01:20:20.900
 I'm not a funny fucking thing in the entire world.

01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:21.900
 Oh, that is.

01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:22.900
 Oh, that is.

01:20:22.900 --> 01:20:23.900
 That's kind of funny.

01:20:23.900 --> 01:20:24.900
 It's so good.

01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:25.900
 [laughter]

01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:26.900
 See, fucking idiot.

01:20:26.900 --> 01:20:27.900
 [laughter]

01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:34.700
 Now I'm going to be very careful in Miami in a couple of months.

01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:36.620
 Do you ever accidentally eat me?

01:20:36.620 --> 01:20:37.620
 No.

01:20:37.620 --> 01:20:42.420
 I've accidentally eaten some dairy in our 11 years, but just a couple of times, and it

01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:45.620
 was like people who didn't understand what vegan was, and the Ozarks, it's like, "Oh,

01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:46.620
 you're vegan?

01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:47.620
 Yeah, I know what that is.

01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:48.620
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:20:48.620 --> 01:20:49.620
 You just don't eat meat."

01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:51.020
 But it's like, "I'm actually more bougie than that.

01:20:51.020 --> 01:20:52.020
 I'm more extra."

01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:53.020
 Yeah.

01:20:53.020 --> 01:20:54.020
 More annoying than that.

01:20:54.020 --> 01:20:55.020
 I don't eat dairy.

01:20:55.020 --> 01:20:56.020
 Yeah, more annoying.

01:20:56.020 --> 01:20:57.020
 [laughter]

01:20:57.020 --> 01:20:59.180
 You can't use 80% of the ingredients in your kitchen.

01:20:59.180 --> 01:21:00.180
 Make me food.

01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:01.180
 Yeah.

01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:02.180
 No, it's impossible.

01:21:02.180 --> 01:21:03.180
 That's the thing.

01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:04.180
 When we went plant-based, we basically don't eat with people.

01:21:04.180 --> 01:21:05.180
 And that kind of sucks.

01:21:05.180 --> 01:21:08.300
 There's a lot of social life, I guess.

01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:13.420
 When people get together, they just eat, and there's not places we go out here to eat.

01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:15.980
 It's just kind of like, it's a thing.

01:21:15.980 --> 01:21:16.980
 People don't want to bring it up.

01:21:16.980 --> 01:21:21.060
 It's tough when you're that vegan body, like, you're like, "Oh, let's go out and fucking

01:21:21.060 --> 01:21:22.900
 have this delicious food."

01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:23.900
 Right?

01:21:23.900 --> 01:21:25.620
 And they're like, "Oh, I'm vegan."

01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:28.340
 I'm like, "Well, then, you know."

01:21:28.340 --> 01:21:29.340
 Good luck.

01:21:29.340 --> 01:21:30.340
 [laughter]

01:21:30.340 --> 01:21:39.060
 Do you have to carry around tactical pouches of fucking Brussels sprouts?

01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:41.020
 We travel with food, Brussels sprouts.

01:21:41.020 --> 01:21:42.020
 We travel.

01:21:42.020 --> 01:21:45.700
 Anytime we go anywhere, even just going to my parents' house, we take food with us.

01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:47.220
 How often do you eat Brussels sprouts?

01:21:47.220 --> 01:21:48.220
 Well, pretty often.

01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:49.220
 I love Brussels sprouts.

01:21:49.220 --> 01:21:50.220
 We do stuff with them.

01:21:50.220 --> 01:21:51.220
 Okay.

01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:52.220
 Yeah, you laugh at it.

01:21:52.220 --> 01:21:53.220
 Like, fucking, it's not a thing that you eat.

01:21:53.220 --> 01:21:54.220
 I'm like, you can eat like 12 fucking things.

01:21:54.220 --> 01:21:55.220
 Oh, no.

01:21:55.220 --> 01:21:56.220
 How are the Brussels sprouts not included?

01:21:56.220 --> 01:21:57.220
 [laughter]

01:21:57.220 --> 01:22:01.300
 That's the thing, I eat so much more variety than I did before.

01:22:01.300 --> 01:22:04.460
 I was super picky as an omnivore.

01:22:04.460 --> 01:22:07.740
 And once we went plant-based, for some reason, I don't know if we had to explore all these

01:22:07.740 --> 01:22:10.300
 new foods, it just expanded a lot of what I eat.

01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:11.620
 So I feel like I eat way more.

01:22:11.620 --> 01:22:13.540
 I bet you like radishes right now, don't you?

01:22:13.540 --> 01:22:14.540
 They're okay.

01:22:14.540 --> 01:22:15.540
 Dude, radishes are amazing.

01:22:15.540 --> 01:22:16.540
 Oh, you don't like them now.

01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:17.540
 I don't know.

01:22:17.540 --> 01:22:18.540
 I'm not super into radishes.

01:22:18.540 --> 01:22:19.540
 I love beet.

01:22:19.540 --> 01:22:20.540
 It's a really good...

01:22:20.540 --> 01:22:21.540
 The fuck?

01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:22.540
 Beets.

01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:23.540
 I love beets.

01:22:23.540 --> 01:22:24.540
 Like, pick some beet.

01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:25.540
 I forget that I eat beets.

01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:26.540
 And then it's like...

01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:27.540
 You can just see inside of your mouth.

01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:28.540
 Time for the game.

01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:29.540
 It's intense.

01:22:29.540 --> 01:22:30.540
 I'm like, "Oh wait, that beets.

01:22:30.540 --> 01:22:31.540
 I'm not dying."

01:22:31.540 --> 01:22:32.540
 [laughter]

01:22:32.540 --> 01:22:33.540
 Beads are fucking good.

01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:34.540
 My wife makes her salad.

01:22:34.540 --> 01:22:35.540
 Yeah, it's good.

01:22:35.540 --> 01:22:36.540
 And it's like...

01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:37.540
 What is it?

01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:55.620
 Like, salad, and then like, mandarin oranges, goat cheese, beets, and French dressing.

01:22:55.620 --> 01:23:01.060
 And somehow, this combination comes together to be a very, very rad.

01:23:01.060 --> 01:23:03.260
 I think it might be like fucking caddied walnuts in there too.

01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:04.260
 I'm not sure, but...

01:23:04.260 --> 01:23:05.260
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:23:05.260 --> 01:23:06.260
 That sounds right.

01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:07.500
 I think I have this type of salad before.

01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:08.500
 It's good.

01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:09.500
 It is good.

01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:10.500
 It is good.

01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:12.460
 I think we've been on here long enough that I need to go.

01:23:12.460 --> 01:23:13.460
 Yeah, probably going to go too.

01:23:13.460 --> 01:23:14.940
 I'm feeling guilty for all that.

01:23:14.940 --> 01:23:16.900
 I've been like half here and half working too.

01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:17.900
 And I feel bad.

01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:20.060
 Well, fellas, it was really nice to hang out.

01:23:20.060 --> 01:23:21.060
 It was really nice to have you on camera.

01:23:21.060 --> 01:23:22.860
 Let's do this like once a month or something.

01:23:22.860 --> 01:23:23.860
 Yeah, there you go.

01:23:23.860 --> 01:23:24.860
 I'm absolutely into that.

01:23:24.860 --> 01:23:29.220
 I'm going to go and make a beautiful stir fry for lunch.

01:23:29.220 --> 01:23:30.980
 You enjoy your mushrooms.

01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:35.100
 Brussels sprouts and beets.

01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:36.100
 I'm sure.

01:23:36.100 --> 01:23:41.860
 He's like, "Yeah, I think a lion's main mushroom."

01:23:41.860 --> 01:23:46.780
 For real, I don't think a day goes by that I don't consume some lion's mushroom.

01:23:46.780 --> 01:23:47.780
 But anyway.

01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:48.780
 How do you have access to it?

01:23:48.780 --> 01:23:49.780
 We eat a lot of mushrooms.

01:23:49.780 --> 01:23:50.780
 How do you have access to it?

01:23:50.780 --> 01:23:51.780
 Oh, damn, at the grocery store.

01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:52.780
 Really?

01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:53.780
 They don't have them at our grocery store.

01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:54.780
 I had to grow them.

01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:57.380
 They don't have lion's main mushrooms in New Jersey.

01:23:57.380 --> 01:23:58.700
 Mushrooms are easy to grow, right?

01:23:58.700 --> 01:23:59.700
 Yeah.

01:23:59.700 --> 01:24:02.300
 You just spray some shit on the dust and just fucking grows.

01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:03.300
 It's amazing.

01:24:03.300 --> 01:24:04.300
 Yeah.

01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:05.300
 It is amazing.

01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:06.300
 All right.

01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:07.300
 All right.

01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:08.300
 All right.

01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:09.300
 All right.

01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:10.300
 All right.

01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:11.300
 On that note.

01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:12.300
 Later, get it.

01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:13.300
 See you guys.

01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:14.300
 Everyone.

01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:14.300
 Bye.

01:24:24.780 --> 01:24:25.780
 Bye.
