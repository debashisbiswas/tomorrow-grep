WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
 I have no idea what we just talked about.

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:02.720
 But vomit.

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.160
 We haven't actually started yet.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.360
 I mean, you could use any of this.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.400
 But yeah, we have.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.120
 Okay, we have.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:07.840
 You know what we have.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.880
 There's no rules.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.240
 You know, Chris will use it from everywhere.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.240
 It's not 34 episodes in a row.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.000
 I'd like to introduce Dax, Rad.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.600
 He's here with us today.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.000
 And it's, it's really nice to have you on Dax.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.760
 I can't say how much it warms my heart that you continue to show up.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:55.280
 You did the thing, the thing, the thing where you just stare at me.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.080
 Oh my goodness. I'm eating a lard bar.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.880
 Maybe we could do an episode where I just say absolutely nothing.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.480
 The whole episode.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.280
 I would know.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.240
 No.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.040
 Why?

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.040
 Pete, we would lose listeners.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.600
 Like, would I be talking to you and you just don't acknowledge it?

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.720
 It's not that I wouldn't be here.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.520
 I would be here and you would just be talking to me.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.040
 And I just would never respond.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.000
 Would you nod?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 Would you ever like acknowledge that I would talk to you?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.600
 I would make facial expressions that do all kinds of stuff.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.720
 Prime is here.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.200
 All right.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.520
 Hi.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.080
 Did you guys do some good leg day today?

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.000
 I've got my pre-workout right here.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.720
 I haven't worked out yet.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.360
 I broke my toe.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.640
 So I've been out of the gym.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.680
 I broke my back.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.600
 Okay, Mike Tyson.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.400
 How are your weeds looking?

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.720
 Oh.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.800
 That sucks.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.360
 Dude, there is a bull thistle that is taller than me.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.440
 There's Canadian thistle that was so tall that it had to be seven and a half feet tall.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.400
 Oh my god.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.200
 Wow.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.640
 Does this pop out out of nowhere?

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.960
 Okay.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.000
 Canadian thistle.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.920
 Okay. I'm going to rant about thistle for a second.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.880
 So you just calm down.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.880
 Canadian thistle.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.200
 Okay.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.680
 So what happened in South Dakota is that we've just been getting rain like every day

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.720
 for the last three weeks or as out of town.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.600
 And so I could just never spray weeds.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.880
 And so they just kept growing.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.880
 I have the most lush weed farm of all time, but no one's getting high and just getting angry.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.800
 You tried smoking it.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.840
 Some bull thistle.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.520
 By the way, did you know that if you put an app sign instead of just typing in the name like a

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.680
 rookie if you put an app sign in your title, it'll actually link out to the person's

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.240
 Twitch account.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.560
 Oh shit.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.480
 I didn't know that hot tip.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.880
 Oh yeah.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.040
 You should always add sign yourself in your own titles because when I click on it, if you

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.840
 have your social links properly set up, it'll also give you a little YouTube Twitter.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.400
 Oh my god.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.600
 Instagram.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.840
 Wow.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.040
 Tips for pro right here.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.760
 It's the thick.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.240
 Wow.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.640
 I know.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.000
 I mean, you guys just got to know what you're doing.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.840
 What is this?

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.720
 Rookie hour?

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.360
 Yeah, kind of.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.440
 That's our vibe, basically.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.120
 It's on your mind.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.000
 Can I read you a direct quote for my co-worker?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.040
 Oh yeah, I like it.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.720
 Prime works at Netflix, by the way.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.080
 If people don't know that.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.480
 I'm going to read you several great quotes of mine.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.240
 This is just so good.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.360
 I go look at this thing.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.960
 There's a decoding in Protobufs where it tries to do a fixed 64 read.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:17.120
 And if that fixed 64 read long to number exceeds the maximum safe integer, it just throws an

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.680
 exception and destroys everything and cannot continue on.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.720
 I saw your tweet about that.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.200
 Yeah.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.080
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.720
 And so his response is freaking JS.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.920
 And I said, I agree.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.280
 And he goes, I hate JS.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.080
 And I go, I agree.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.680
 And your response with who needs more than 53 bits?

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.080
 I say, well, who needs more than 53 bits?

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.640
 Save one.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.600
 Do you know why that's the case?

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.720
 My assumption is that the early implementations of a garbage collection and all that,

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.800
 they saved space for something to like put crap in.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.800
 But no, I just think it's stupid and annoying.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.560
 And then later on, I go, well, I don't really want to rewrite this and go unless if I have to,

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.840
 can you like put a flag to stop using nanoseconds?

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.920
 And they're like, well, we could.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:09.040
 But you could also just use a more professional language that has a good and proper scheduling

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.640
 runtime and parallel processing proposition, AKA green threads, an ecosystem that's more pro.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.880
 And I don't think you end up with a bazillion NPM package of doubtful quality.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.720
 JS makes sense for the web.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.280
 And outside of that for tooling, it makes no sense.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.600
 I don't see any value at all.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.800
 JS feels like a hack on top of a hack-ish flash continuously involving language.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.960
 Once you've tried anything else, unless you have to use TS or JS, I do not see a reason,

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.000
 a reason for doing so.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.200
 This is all like internal.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.680
 Yeah.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.640
 Just talking.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.480
 It doesn't have a way to get this off their chest.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.360
 Oh, God, it was so good.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.640
 And I was just like, then I was just like, well, I agree.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.840
 What now?

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.080
 I didn't make the choice.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.600
 I don't know what happened here.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.160
 The problem is, is everybody wants their cake and they want to eat the two.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.960
 You want to be able to distribute something in which you don't have to compile.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.040
 But ultimately, you still have to run something stupid like TS note or some sort of compilation,

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.400
 because it almost never works.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.160
 ESM is a complete disaster.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.680
 I hate ESM.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.840
 What is this, a TS red scour?

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.320
 I knew something was on your mind.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.840
 Why do you hate ESM?

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:16.720
 Let's get into it.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.040
 Oh my goodness, okay, okay, so here we go.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.280
 So the whole point of ESM is that it's supposed to like save you from all this bullshit.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.360
 Well, the problem with ESM is that you have to mark yourself as a module,

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:33.600
 and then all the rules that have applied to node up to date no longer apply.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.600
 So you have to include.js.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.560
 So that means if you use say, I don't know, any library ever written in NPM,

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.960
 and you mark yourself as a module, it's just like, I can't find that.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.600
 I don't know what this, I don't know what this import statement is.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:53.200
 And you're just like, f***, I have an auto-generated code in which I have no control over,

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.440
 in which just assumes they will do a .js for you, ruins everything.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.880
 And you just chase bug after bug after bug.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.640
 And I can't just be patched in the world.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.440
 And then when you patch the world, it breaks for the other person.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.960
 And then they're like, well, you can't do that.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.200
 And so it's like this incompatible, I mean, first off, it's the stupidest problem of all time.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.080
 You literally import and you export.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.080
 The export is just a pojo.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.040
 That's all it is.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:24.240
 And somehow we've derived a system in which two of identical things can't work together

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.240
 in a language that is dynamic.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.200
 Like what kind of crazy world are we at?

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.520
 Yeah, at this point, you like have to use a bundler.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.320
 But I feel I'm hoping at some point, all that old stuff just dies.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.760
 Everything's ESM only.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.280
 And I think things will be better then, potentially.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.200
 Yeah, but I mean, that's like an impossible thing.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.640
 That's like saying, oh, I can't.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.320
 I mean, once everyone quits using Python 2.7, everything will be great.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.920
 That was like a decade ago.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.720
 No, no, I agree.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.400
 The thing is, how many dependencies do you need?

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.560
 I need like 10 dependencies total, maybe, for like 99% of my work.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.880
 I just need them to go ESM only.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.000
 But yeah, like people just will stack like a billion.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.440
 There's like what, like millions of MPM packages that will never be updated.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.360
 But I'm kind of hoping they die for that reason.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.040
 I know, but like if you need to use, say, a protobuf,

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.320
 you now have to convince Google to update to their ESM.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.640
 They're not updating TSM, right?

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:21.680
 So you're going to have to write your own little fun protobuf version that is in ESM.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.040
 I mean, they don't even work.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:27.200
 Right now, I'm literally using said to replace things at runtime

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.280
 because it doesn't understand default exports in the own protobuf generator.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.600
 And it's just like, oh, gosh, I hate this language.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.280
 If you compile with ESM, because ESM has built handles a lot of those cases.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.560
 Have you tried that?

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.040
 Yeah.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.000
 No, no good.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.360
 Some things are just incompatible because once you mark yourself as a module,

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.680
 generated code can't be like unadhering to those rules.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.200
 Oh, generate a code within your own.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.240
 Ah, I see, I see.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.600
 Yeah, it's up to then your own code base.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.120
 Yeah, because protobufs, right?

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.560
 Once you generate code, once you have to use, say, two languages

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.880
 and you want to schema the share between the Twixtum.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:07:59.840
 The Twixt?

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:00.960
 I mean, you're in trouble?

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:01.280
 Yeah.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:09.040
 How big are you physically in real life?

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.560
 Dax is 510.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.200
 How big am I?

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.240
 Six foot and some change.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.760
 OK, I'm actually the smallest here.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:14.560
 How much change?

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.640
 Enough to call myself in the six feet.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:17.600
 That's all that matters.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.480
 I'm no Theo.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.600
 My dad was six four.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.360
 My grandfather was six five.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.120
 I somehow came out of six foot.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.560
 My son's probably going to be six five.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.280
 I don't know what happened.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:25.680
 Oh, man.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.440
 I went the other way.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.560
 My entire family is like five six and I'm five 10.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.920
 So I'm grateful for what I got.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.200
 Got lucky.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.480
 Yeah, no, you got to be.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.960
 You do your above statistical average.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:37.920
 I love that.

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.040
 That's good.

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.920
 My dad is exactly my height and my two brothers are my height.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.320
 So I just assumed like all males in a family

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.840
 would always be the same height.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.080
 And my wife thinks my young or my oldest

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:48.880
 is going to be really tall.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.200
 But I just didn't think it's like I'm the ceiling.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.320
 This is as tall as you can get.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.760
 Can you get a prediction for your kids?

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.280
 Yeah, there's like growth plate predictions

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:55.920
 and stuff like that.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.960
 But oh, really?

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.320
 Yeah, you can do like like they can do some basic

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.040
 guesstimation.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.160
 But mine was off.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.200
 I was supposed to be taller.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.480
 Never quite made it there.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.440
 High five myself.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.880
 But that's still clapping.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.360
 But I mean, the thing is, is that like I don't have a neck.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.000
 As you can see, like I literally start from a chin

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.640
 and meet the top of my chest within like an inch and a half.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.120
 OK, so no one knows what happened to my neck.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.280
 But my wife, her neck is like a giraffe.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.280
 She has like 17 inches of neck.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.920
 And my son got her neck, but he got my legs.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.320
 And if you don't know, my legs start right around here.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.920
 So I don't have this same point either.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:30.960
 I have no torso.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.880
 Dude, finding pants and like shirt ratios always so hard.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.000
 Yeah, not only that, but my wife, when she sits down

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.400
 and I sit down, we are a half inch difference

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.640
 when we both sit up as straight as possible.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.120
 And I am six and some inches taller than her.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.840
 So she's literally all torso.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:51.360
 So my son got her torso and her neck and got my legs.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.880
 The kids can be six foot 12.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.480
 I don't know if I have such a joke.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.440
 Is he playing basketball?

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.000
 Crazy.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.320
 I'm trying to convince him to.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:58.960
 I love basketball.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.000
 So I played a bunch of basketball.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.960
 So I'm hoping he will.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:01.680
 What about you, Adam?

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:02.880
 You played basketball too, right?

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.760
 I did play basketball.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.920
 I can't relate with you short torso people.

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.240
 I've got a very long torso and average legs.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.440
 What are you doing in tech?

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:09.920
 Me?

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:10.560
 Yeah.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.720
 People with your bi proportions don't belong here.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.040
 Yeah, I might get out.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:15.920
 I think I'm a swimmer.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.440
 I should be a swimmer probably.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.560
 I did some swimming.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.120
 I don't know.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.280
 My brother-in-law was an Olympic swimmer.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.160
 Really?

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:22.560
 What?

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:23.840
 Got six in Beijing.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.880
 Is he Michael Phelps?

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:25.520
 What?

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.160
 He lived with Michael Phelps and raced against him

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.520
 in the Beijing one.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.560
 That is crazy.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:31.920
 Yeah.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:32.720
 Does he have a long neck?

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.520
 No, but he was in his prime super shape when I met him.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.400
 Yeah, he was like one and a half humans.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:44.160
 Is everyone in your family physically superior to you?

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.320
 Yeah, yeah, everywhere.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.760
 It's very, it's very shady.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.760
 Except for I can grow a better facial hair than everybody else.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.200
 So I do win, right?

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.040
 Have you gone the full beard?

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:55.600
 Yeah.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.640
 It's just that, you know, no.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.480
 I mean, Dax, this is going to hurt you a little bit,

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.720
 but no matter what you do and no matter how thick it is,

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.640
 it's just way too pubey for me.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.160
 I just can't handle it.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:04.800
 You know what I mean?

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.040
 It's just like, it's annoying.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.000
 And I don't want any of that.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.600
 So, you know, mustache, I went with a mustache because it was awesome.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.440
 And now everybody has a mustache.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.320
 Yeah, I changed it up.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.160
 Like everybody has a mustache.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.640
 I walked down the street and there's just every guy has a mustache.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.680
 I'm like, how did this happen?

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.360
 Like no one likes mustaches.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.320
 I thought they're awesome.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.600
 And now they're just everywhere.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.240
 It's crazy how life changes on a dime.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.600
 And all of a sudden one day, nothing's there.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.640
 And the next day they're everywhere.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:29.680
 Maybe you set the trend.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.320
 I don't think I set it.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.680
 How many people are in your town?

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:32.240
 70,000?

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.560
 Do people like your neighbors know what you do?

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:34.880
 No.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.160
 Do they know you're the prime engine?

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.200
 No, no one does.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:37.600
 Nothing.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.560
 What about your work?

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.320
 Like your coworker you were just talking about?

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.240
 Oh yeah, I get messages all the time.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:42.720
 Good ones?

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:46.880
 I'll be like, well, sometimes I get mess, I get all sorts of,

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.000
 I get all sorts of things.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.280
 I got people, I got, I've been blocked by coworkers.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.960
 I've received not so nice messages from coworkers

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.240
 and I've received great things, right?

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.520
 How does that work with like, when you say blocked,

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.040
 are they blocking you on the work slack?

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.320
 Like what do you mean they're blocking you?

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.600
 Oh yeah, I've been blocked on work slack.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.080
 Are you serious?

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.680
 Like I've refused to respond.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:10.000
 Yeah, I've sent, there's this one person in which I had no idea.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.360
 How I discovered it is Netflix UI engineering tweeted something

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.840
 and then I couldn't see any of the messages.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:18.960
 So I was like, oh, that's strange.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.480
 I must be one of those like, you know,

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.800
 because on Twitter you can do some sort of like mass blocking.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.120
 Yeah.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.280
 And sometimes you catch a stray bullet

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.720
 and you're just like, oopsie daisies.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.120
 So I reached out to them on Slack and I'm like, yo, I don't,

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.800
 I don't, this must be a mistake or something.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.960
 Hey, if I say anything, I'm, I'm sorry.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.320
 I have no idea who you are.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.120
 I've never even met you.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.320
 Didn't respond.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.320
 I was like, hmm, that seems a little strange.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.120
 Maybe he just missed it.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:39.680
 Maybe he's on.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.520
 Oh, so I like, oh, two months later,

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.280
 I, I re-pinged him and was just like, hey,

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:44.880
 yeah, if there is something just like, let me know.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.000
 I'm glad to talk about this.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.640
 I think with my literal words and still nothing.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.720
 So I'm like, that is super strange.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.280
 I know someone he's friends with that I'm also friends with.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.440
 So I reached out to him and they're like, oh yeah, he hates you.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.880
 And I'm like, what did I do?

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:00.560
 And so.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.400
 How does that work with like the company?

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.960
 Like, you just have employees blocking each other.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:05.680
 Like, do they care?

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:10.560
 Netflix used to be a place that valued really strongly direct feedback.

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.400
 And now I feel like it's, it's less so.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.960
 The next generation that's coming in,

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.240
 it doesn't seem to be as valued on that level.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.760
 It just seems like we more avoid it.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:20.720
 Maybe it's a cultural thing.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.960
 Maybe now every generation feels that way.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.440
 But the first commit I ever made to Netflix,

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.600
 this guy named Jerry Hamlet comes up to me and goes,

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.320
 he was just literally like, hey, you're a f***ing idiot.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.160
 You need to fix this right now.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.160
 And I was just like, okay, Maria.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.000
 And it's just like, we talked it out.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.200
 It was great feedback.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.080
 And he was super harsh, straight to the point.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.480
 And it was fantastic, right?

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.480
 And that's like my first two years at Netflix.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.720
 Like everyone was just like, whoa, what's that?

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:47.760
 That's not right, right?

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.920
 Like, direct, right to the point.

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.760
 We called it, no s*** sandwiches.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.200
 Hey, you're a really nice guy.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.280
 I think you're really great by the way, this is bullshit.

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.800
 But you know, you're a really cool person.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.840
 Like there's like no bullshit sandwiches, no s*** sandwiches.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.280
 And so I don't know what happened.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:02.240
 Something happened now.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.240
 People can't take feedback and everyone gets hurt.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.680
 That's what I've heard about Netflix is the thing you described before.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.400
 I mean, I've heard that you guys are known for being very direct,

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.600
 but that's faded, huh?

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.240
 I think it's faded.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.200
 I've been here for a decade.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.280
 So I mean, when people say, oh, no, it's the same.

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.120
 They just probably haven't been here for a decade.

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:20.400
 Remote work may have probably hurt that a lot.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:24.160
 It's hard to have direct feedback when you can't see someone's body language.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.520
 When you can, you know, like text is extremely easy to misinterpret.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.840
 You know, there's all these barriers to entry.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.760
 If you're already upset, it's somebody to be like, hey,

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.160
 let's get into a Google meets, right?

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.240
 Like you can't just walk over to their desk and be like,

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.920
 yellow past this out really quickly.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:41.440
 I mean, I've the what you're describing, that's pretty much how I've always worked.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.840
 Like it's been pretty harsh at times and direct.

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.880
 And I've liked it because obviously it's stressful in the moment.

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.960
 But overall, it just brings everyone together.

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.240
 Like you're like breaking repair.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.400
 And that's kind of what creates good relationships.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.800
 Yeah. When did you notice it going away?

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:58.560
 Because I feel like more as like industry-wide,

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:01.120
 I feel the last five years have just been really weird.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:04.000
 Like a lot of weird stuff has shifted in the last five years.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.080
 I feel like it's going to return back to how it was.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:09.360
 But yeah, when did you guys start to see that change?

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:12.240
 Okay, I thought Adam was going to answer, but instead he's just eating.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.520
 That was a question for you, friend.

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:17.040
 Okay, well, he said you guys, that's multiple.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.480
 I just got done dominating.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.400
 So I want him to give Adam an opportunity.

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.120
 I just like to say right now.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.720
 Jumping it in his actual face.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.400
 Disgusting.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.160
 Last week, he spilled a bunch of apples on the floor.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.600
 It was a freaking disaster.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:32.800
 Ridiculous, Adam.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.640
 I've noticed about it in the last five years too.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.240
 That feels about right.

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.800
 Like things started shifting.

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.920
 I think when the world, so okay,

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.760
 I'm not trying to get into any sort of politics.

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.200
 So I want you to know, I'm not doing politics.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.840
 But I think at some point in our country,

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.280
 the political became the personal.

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:49.920
 Yeah.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.560
 And so it's just like everything has to be politicized.

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:56.400
 And I think right around then is when I started seeing a lot of fracturing,

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.320
 where people became really like,

00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.920
 intense about a lot of things.

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:01.840
 And then when everyone became super intense,

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.640
 it also, there's this weird distancing that also happened

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.880
 at our job where it's just like,

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.120
 if you say something, it's like you're attacking somebody.

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.880
 And it's like, well, no, I'm not attacking you.

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.160
 I want this to be better.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.640
 Like I'm not trying to like, this is not,

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:15.520
 we're not sparring.

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:16.720
 Like life is not a spar.

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:20.400
 Sometimes it's just like co-becoming better.

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:21.920
 I don't know what happened.

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:23.040
 Yeah, it's just a process.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:27.360
 I have a pretty like cynical explanation for this,

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.080
 but I honestly feel like a lot of these companies,

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.800
 the pressure kind of got removed in the last five years,

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.360
 just because the amount they were all growing,

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.480
 how easy everything was.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.680
 So I feel like it was easy to get distracted by things

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.840
 that didn't necessarily like,

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.440
 leaped anywhere good.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.600
 And I feel like that pressure come back on.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:49.360
 And I have seen a lot of kind of what you're describing

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.240
 decrease as well.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.280
 It felt for a while like, wow,

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:52.720
 this is just a world we're going to live in forever.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:53.840
 Like it's just going in this direction.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.040
 It's going to continue to go in that direction.

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:58.240
 But I'm seeing a lot less of that.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.880
 I feel like all the people that are influential

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.800
 and are like talking about things,

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.880
 it's less, it's way less of that other stuff.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.920
 So I'm hoping it's going to get better.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.200
 Okay, I'm going to be right back,

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.800
 but I want to hear more of what you're trying to say

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.360
 because you used a lot of general words in which mean nothing.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.080
 It used to mean this and now that.

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:20.000
 And I'm like, I don't know what this or that means

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:20.960
 in this situation.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.120
 Go into yourself and we'll get specific.

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:26.320
 Maybe prime would do like some really direct feedback for us

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:27.280
 in our podcast.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.400
 Maybe he could just like bring back the Netflix directness.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.280
 No shit sandwich.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.760
 Just straight down the pipe.

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:34.640
 What do you think?

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:35.120
 I don't want it.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:35.760
 Are we ready for it?

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:36.560
 I'm just kidding.

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:37.120
 You don't want it.

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:41.440
 I would have expected me to be the one that wouldn't want it.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.040
 How long do you have to drink your pre-workout

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.160
 before your workout?

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.120
 For maximum effect.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:47.360
 I don't know. I actually never.

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:50.000
 Do you drink a pre-workout person?

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.520
 Oh really?

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:52.000
 Okay.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:52.960
 It gets me in the mood.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.720
 You ever took nitric oxide?

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.240
 No, I did beat juice.

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.760
 Well, it's like beats and some other stuff.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:58.080
 Okay.

00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.040
 Like bone or medication.

00:17:59.040 --> 00:17:59.760
 Similar effect.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.760
 Nitric oxide.

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.920
 Something about okay pre-workout has a bad rep,

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:06.960
 so I never explored it.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:07.840
 It has a bad rep.

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:08.640
 Because people are always like.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.040
 Oh really?

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:09.280
 I don't know.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.200
 I always like hear people like go nuts

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.360
 and take pre-workout and it's like, it's, I don't know,

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.480
 enlighten me.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.160
 Snort a line of pre-workout.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.400
 I mean this is literally a bro-life science

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.320
 where he like snorts a line of pre-workout

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.080
 and then does, you know, cleans for now.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:22.640
 Yeah, exactly.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.280
 But then Adam's talking about beat juice,

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:28.480
 which is a very different vibe than what I imagine pre-workout to be.

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.640
 It increases your blood flow.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:31.520
 To where?

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:32.800
 Did you know that about beats?

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.480
 To your body, Dax.

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.480
 To your whole body.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.000
 It's psychological for me.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.880
 Like if I take it, now I know I have to work out.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.360
 Because I'm not going to waste a drink, you know?

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.200
 Like if I drank it, I'm working out.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.000
 Okay, hold on.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.800
 We got a, can we rewind this for a quick?

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:49.200
 Yes.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:49.840
 Quick second.

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:52.000
 How did you guys get here?

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.200
 And where did you read beat juice is a pre-workout?

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.960
 Adam just asked me about pre-workout

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.400
 and I was like, I don't know anything.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.360
 I was just, I have to take my 90 minutes before my workout.

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:04.560
 So I have to figure out the math of like 90 minutes from now.

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.400
 And I just, I was trying to figure out if I should drink it.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.400
 So I asked Dax, how long do you have to drink your pre-workout?

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.840
 I thought he took pre-workout too.

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.200
 Thought it was probably a lot less time.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.320
 That was where I was headed with it.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:14.640
 He doesn't even do it.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.880
 So what you're trying to tell me is Dax doesn't even,

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:17.600
 he doesn't even lift.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:18.400
 Do you even lift bro?

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.360
 He doesn't even work out.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.480
 I don't even think he works out.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:22.320
 Because I don't stream anymore.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.920
 He only used to work out when I streamed.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.960
 My workout routine was watching Adam in between my sets.

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.680
 And now I work out and watch you.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:30.080
 I know.

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.840
 You gotta get back to streaming.

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:32.960
 It's a circle of lash.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.960
 This is a strange podcast.

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:38.240
 We are recording.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.320
 Going back to where it's on before.

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.640
 Okay, let me speak with more specific words.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.800
 I mean, everyone blames everything on interest rates.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:48.560
 And it's kind of like an overly used explanation of things.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.520
 But I feel like in the last couple of years,

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:56.080
 stuff wasn't really easy in terms of like if you're starting a company,

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:59.200
 it shouldn't be easy to boost evaluation next round.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.280
 If you just have to do certain things,

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:04.080
 those things weren't necessarily tied to reality.

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.520
 They weren't tied to your business.

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:06.400
 Literally doing better.

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.480
 Literally becoming more sustainable.

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:13.120
 All the things that prior to that that we were doing and learned to do

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.640
 just became a detethered from that.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:19.920
 And so I would see a lot of these companies get really, really big,

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:23.200
 completely devoid of reality.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.800
 And I think when you have situations like that,

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:28.000
 the odd behaviors come up that people think make sense.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.520
 Like they focus on certain areas,

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.840
 or they like think hiring a certain way makes sense.

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:34.240
 So they think like caring about certain things makes sense.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:38.400
 And there's like a return to reality where you figure out

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.040
 what behaviors actually made sense and which didn't.

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:43.200
 And I think in the moment, for most people,

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.400
 a lot of it seems logical.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:48.640
 And it seems extremely illogical in hindsight when all that stuff kind of goes away.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.960
 So I feel like there's been a phase where,

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.800
 especially in some of these massive companies where

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:56.560
 people were just focusing on stuff that just wasn't

00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:00.400
 work related or like push the bar or like made the company better.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.760
 And they were kind of in cushy situations.

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.800
 And then the focus was on like, there's other things, right?

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:13.120
 I feel like I haven't seen that as much in the last like year or so.

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.480
 It was harder to raise money.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:18.800
 Yeah, I mean, I think, I mean, I think I see what you're trying to say.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:22.560
 But I do, I reject your hypothesis.

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:23.920
 Tell me more.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:24.400
 Ooh.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:31.760
 I don't think the pressure or the difficulty of a job is related to the current feeling

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.400
 or zeitgeist of how people take feedback.

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.840
 I guess, yes, maybe they're taking feedback parts, but I guess what I'm trying to say is

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:43.600
 the overall culture of being able to what's so called like a cater to that, I guess.

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:46.960
 I think that's been something that's newer.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:51.120
 That's like been a thing that's, again, in the last five years, showed up.

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:54.480
 Because there was a gluttony of, you know, VC money all flowing in.

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.920
 Because every company could potentially be a billion dollar company.

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:01.280
 Yeah, every company had like, you know, five times more people than they needed,

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:04.400
 you know, like strictly speaking, like a lot of people didn't have a lot of

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.720
 like literal work to do.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.040
 Of course, all work inflates to whatever time you give it.

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.080
 So it felt like it did.

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.760
 But yeah, I feel like we're entering a new phase now.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:18.160
 And I'm just not seeing, especially in the, I get, I operate entirely in like extremely

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:19.360
 early stage companies.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.800
 I definitely see like a crazy focusing on all sorts of things, right?

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:29.440
 Like before people, companies would be really excited to like hire a bunch of people and like

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:34.800
 do a bunch of like external facing things and like brag about their fundraise, etc.

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:40.160
 I'm seeing way more focus on, yes, we raise money, but we're kind of back heads down and

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:43.840
 kind of on building and everyone's, I feel that there's a shift in being more sustainable and

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:48.160
 not taking the next round for granted, which I think is good.

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.680
 I think that's a good natural state of things.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.360
 Yeah, I'd be, I'm on that team.

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:52.960
 I like that.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:56.640
 I'm just not sure if it has much to do with the feedback part.

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:59.520
 So where do you think the feedback is coming from?

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:07.280
 I still, I still think it's that there's become a bit of a, an attachment to what you do is who

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.080
 you are.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:09.280
 Identity, yeah.

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:13.520
 Yeah, identity has gotten mixed up because you know, we, you know, everyone, everyone.

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:14.560
 So, so, okay.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.080
 Now we're going to get into philosophical primes.

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.280
 So sit down.

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.920
 Okay.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.560
 So anyone here know what the word worship means?

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:23.440
 Oh, yeah, we're doing it.

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:24.720
 Would the word worship means?

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:25.760
 It comes from the old English.

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:31.120
 Yeah, it comes, it comes from the old English term worth shape, meaning the worth of something

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.880
 shapes who you are.

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:33.600
 Okay.

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:34.640
 Everybody worships.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:39.680
 So what is our culture worshiping at one point and may have been family, it may have been

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:42.560
 country, it may have been God, but now itself.

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:47.200
 Self is currently the thing that we take our most work, our most worth from, right?

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:51.360
 And at least in our culture, at least, that's why you do you get rid of everyone that holds

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:51.840
 you back.

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:55.520
 All these kinds of phrases exist is because what is the thing that's trying to drive our

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:56.640
 worth right now?

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:57.520
 Now it's ourself.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:02.640
 And so I think that a lot of this is tying into this hypersensitivity because that means

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.640
 what you do is who you are.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:08.320
 And when someone says this isn't good, what they're saying is you aren't good.

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:11.120
 Who you are, like fundamentally isn't good.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:15.600
 And I think that that takes our huge, I think that just greatly changes the culture.

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:16.400
 Personal opinion.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:16.880
 Interesting.

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:19.520
 So what's the right mindset to have?

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.600
 What should you worship?

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.760
 Well, I think I know, but that's me.

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:27.760
 I think God's the answer because at least you have a fixed point that can't change.

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:32.480
 Whereas if you have a point that changes, it's just whatever is the popular opinion of the day.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.600
 Yeah.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:39.840
 I mean, we talked a little bit about this in a few podcasts ago, but I think there is a lot

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:44.320
 of benefits from worshiping yourself because you get to figure stuff out and you get a little

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:44.960
 more choice.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:49.920
 But with that choice, you're like trying to reinvent literally every single aspect of

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:51.200
 what it means to be a person.

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.760
 And that's overwhelming.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:57.200
 And I don't think most of us are set up to make great decisions there.

00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:00.240
 I think there's a lot of wisdom in how we've been living.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:04.400
 And I think there's probably a room for some amount of change with that with a lot of that.

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:11.840
 But I think we throw away a lot of what works in the newfound freedom that we all have in the

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:12.720
 modern world.

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:13.360
 Yeah.

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:17.280
 Yeah, I'm not, you know, absolute freedom is not necessarily absolute freedom, right?

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:21.920
 Officially works if it's in water, if it has a certain set of constraints. I think humans, you know,

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:25.600
 like, I don't think our modern push, I don't, now we're getting real weird.

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:30.640
 I don't think the modern push for like, like, ultimate and say anyone can use any drug is really

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:33.920
 great because there's a lot of people that are complete slaves to drugs living on the street and

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.360
 we're celebrating that as like a positive.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:35.680
 Yeah.

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:38.000
 I don't, I don't feel like that's a positive win for society.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.200
 I don't think it's positive win for the individual to say it's okay to do that

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.200
 because ultimately it just leads to pure slavery.

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:47.920
 So ultimate freedom is not necessarily freedom, right? It's it.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.360
 You can very well enslave yourself.

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:52.560
 I'm just realizing, listen to you guys talk like how little I think about

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:56.560
 anything with depth at all because like you guys have thought about.

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.760
 Well, what do you think about when you're sitting on your, you're just staring at a wall and like,

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:03.600
 not thinking about anything? Like what, what's going on in your head? What's rumbling around?

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.040
 Just not deep thing.

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:08.160
 I don't know. I think I think about like what I have to do that day.

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:13.120
 Right now I'm thinking about Japanese characters because I'm learning Japanese.

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.160
 What's up with that? Why are you learning Japanese?

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:14.640
 Is that new?

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.800
 We want to go to Japan.

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:19.920
 And I want to watch anime and actually, no, not really.

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:27.280
 I knew as the lie, the moment he said, we, I was like,

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:30.800
 this is a singular activity.

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:35.040
 I tried with Liz too. We watched one episode death now and she was like,

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:37.200
 not for me. And then she just never tried it again.

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:41.680
 So my wife and I loved she really was into it, Alice in Borderland.

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.760
 So you got live action anime, effectively.

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:45.440
 Is live action anime ever good?

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:49.840
 I thought Alice, besides for like the classic, you stare too long and just just like,

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:53.040
 run bitch, right? Like you can't just like, everyone just stands there like,

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:59.280
 works in one form, but it doesn't work until it's live action.

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:01.520
 But yeah, Alice in Borderland was, I thought it was great.

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:02.320
 You got to check it out.

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.640
 Queen of Hearts, great character.

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:08.240
 I'm new to all this. I haven't really explored this that much. So I just watched

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.640
 Attack on Titan. I just finished Death Note yesterday.

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.360
 I'm looking for my next one now.

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:15.360
 Wow, you're really going in on this.

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.560
 I know what a waifu is.

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:19.440
 I still don't kind of get it.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.160
 What's a weeb? And someone tell me what a weeb is?

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.160
 Someone obsessed with Japanese culture.

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.120
 Oh, okay.

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:27.360
 That's you. Well, now that you're learning Japanese.

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:28.320
 I'm learning Japanese.

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:30.800
 So I guess I'm one of the simplest way to put it.

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:36.240
 That's probably fairly one-dimensional take on it, but that's the easiest way to translate it into

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:36.880
 old man.

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:41.600
 So like with a stereotypical kind of like white guy with like swords in his bedroom,

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:42.720
 that guy, that's a weeb?

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.240
 Swords.

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:48.480
 I don't, I mean, I also have three separate katanas, but that doesn't necessarily mean I'm a weeb.

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:54.160
 I happen to fit potentially your description.

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:57.520
 But it's a little bit, it's a little bit more than that.

00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:01.200
 You have to be specifically interested in Japanese culture.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.400
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.320
 I've been gifted three swords throughout my life.

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.960
 You've been gifted them by different people.

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:07.680
 Yeah.

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:10.080
 Wait, three different people, hang on.

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:10.960
 Three different people.

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.040
 Two people, two people, three swords.

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:15.120
 Two different people gifted.

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.720
 Did you tell them, did you make a list?

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:17.760
 No.

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:19.840
 Like was this a Christmas list scenario?

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:20.160
 No.

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.880
 Completely independent gifting.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.960
 Mr. Privagen, here is a sword.

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:28.560
 Long before I was priming in, my gamer tag was Kilroy Jenkins during those days.

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:33.920
 So they get, so one person gives you a sword and then later followed up with a second sword.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:34.320
 Nope.

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:37.280
 It was one sword and then someone gave me two swords.

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:37.680
 At once.

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:38.880
 Oh, at once.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.080
 Two swords at once.

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:40.400
 Yeah.

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.760
 Were those people weeb's?

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.760
 No, neither of them were.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:44.800
 Is weeb derogatory?

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:46.160
 Should I not be saying that out loud?

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:47.680
 I feel like, is it's leaving my lips?

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:48.240
 It feels bad.

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:51.840
 I think you can, just like a simp, you can make a derogatory or not.

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:52.320
 Okay.

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:52.480
 Okay.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.600
 Are you guys going to Japan?

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.440
 I don't know, that's what like, we want to take the kids to Japan.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:58.160
 Like if we're going overseas, we've heard good things.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.520
 It's very clean, safe.

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:00.960
 Kids can just walk around in Japan.

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.160
 Are we talking about this?

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.800
 Yeah, kids don't can't necessarily walk around in Japan.

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.000
 I, I, in fact, I know.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:06.640
 Oh, they can't.

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:13.520
 I know, personally, two people whose exclusive job is to fund a paramilitary operation of

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:16.000
 rescuing children specifically from Japan.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:16.400
 What?

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:17.280
 Okay.

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:20.640
 I'm going to learn something different and we're not going to Japan.

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:24.240
 You just never let your kids just walk around completely unfettered

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.440
 if they're young enough.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.760
 Yeah, I think my wife saw it on TikTok.

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.840
 It was like, the kids just walking around.

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.920
 Okay, that's, that's a show problem.

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.680
 There's a reality show in Japan.

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:35.120
 It's, it's a little bit, it's a little bit old.

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:40.640
 I feel what it's called, but they basically take a kid, maybe like three or four years old,

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:43.600
 and they give them like a bunch of tasks and they send them on their own.

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:46.800
 And there's obviously a camera crew like circling them, so they're not literally on their own,

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.800
 but they just kind of like figure it out and you watch.

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:49.680
 It's really cute.

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:52.640
 It's funny, but it makes Japan look, look so nice.

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:53.280
 That's a show.

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:53.840
 Yeah, it's a show.

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.520
 It's, it's pretty funny.

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:56.160
 You just check it out.

00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:00.480
 Maybe that's what you're, maybe that's what she's seeing in.

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:02.560
 Maybe it's relatively safe though, you know.

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:03.520
 Relatively safe.

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:04.080
 Okay.

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:06.080
 I mean, I like the like, the buildings look cool.

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.040
 I don't know.

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:07.200
 Yeah.

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:08.960
 Like architecture over there.

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:10.720
 Have you been overseas before Adam?

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.080
 I've been to Mexico.

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:14.960
 We went to an orphanage in Mexico before we had kids.

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:15.360
 An orphan?

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:16.720
 Is that where you got your kids?

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:16.960
 No.

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:21.120
 Uh, that's it though.

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:24.000
 I guess I've been in Canadian waters up in Buffalo.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.680
 We went to the Niagara Falls.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:26.160
 Interesting.

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:28.080
 I think we probably dipped into Canada a little bit.

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:29.520
 It's going to be a big culture shock.

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:34.240
 Like people that go from the west to Asia, it's like very, very different.

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.320
 Until you hit a squatty potty, it doesn't set in.

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:39.840
 Like, that's when that's like when you're trying to figure out how to

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:46.320
 to book them down in a while, like trying to be over something like,

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:47.840
 dude, that's a whole different experience.

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:51.360
 I mean, my wife is really big into like, we're squatting now with the kids all the time,

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.280
 trying to make sure we can like do that with our bodies.

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:56.400
 Cause I guess like in the west, we lose that ability as we get older.

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:57.680
 Like you just can't squat anymore.

00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:00.080
 So I think, can you squat backs?

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:00.400
 Yeah.

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.640
 I'm 31 years old with the full, I don't know.

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:03.920
 Maybe he's sitting in a chair a lot.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.040
 But he may not be able to squat.

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:06.080
 You may actually not be able to.

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:06.560
 You might not be able to.

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:10.480
 You have to maintain neutral spine and how far can you go down while maintaining?

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:11.760
 Where's your butt wink at?

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:13.360
 You know, that's a very popular phrase.

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:16.080
 You know, if we know what we're talking about.

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:20.400
 But it's where as you squat down, your main neutral spine and then you'll curve.

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:20.800
 I squat.

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:24.560
 When I work out squatting, it's like my primary thing that I work on.

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:26.320
 But like you can go to the ground.

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:27.280
 Yes.

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:28.560
 All five for 10 of you can.

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:31.600
 For your time, let's take space over here.

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.280
 You know, I was born in India.

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:37.680
 So the first toilets I used were the hole in the ground toilets.

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:38.480
 Oh.

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:39.280
 Yeah.

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:39.600
 Wow.

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:43.680
 I think objectively they're worse, to be honest.

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:45.680
 I don't think it's like, you can go this way or that way.

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:51.680
 Think to me, I'm like, okay, I get that your body is like in a more natural state.

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:55.040
 And like at home, we have little squatty potty stool things

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:57.040
 to like put your feet on when you use a toilet.

00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.280
 But something about the hole in the ground.

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:02.400
 It's like, it's like a lot of balance, a lot of things can go wrong.

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.760
 I mean, they're nice ones.

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:06.800
 Are there ones that have like a nice rim around the hole or something?

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:07.360
 I don't know.

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:09.680
 I've porcelain squatty potty before.

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:10.240
 KTV.

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:13.280
 Okay, I was going to say like, we're the wealthy people in India.

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:14.000
 What are they?

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.080
 The other thing is toilet paper is not a thing, which I think is actually better

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:20.640
 because my friend said this thing to me once.

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:20.960
 Okay.

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:23.680
 Because you wash, you wash, you don't just finish and leave.

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.040
 You don't wash your butt a lot.

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:27.680
 My friend said this thing.

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:28.240
 He didn't want to.

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:31.760
 He's like, imagine throwing up and not washing your face.

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:34.000
 It's like wiping the vomit off your face.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.920
 And he's like, that's what you do with your butt when you poop, when you don't use a bidet.

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:38.720
 Blood vomit.

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:39.600
 Yeah, exactly.

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:40.640
 You just put it on, man.

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:41.840
 You just wipe it off.

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:43.600
 And you know, you didn't get all of that.

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:48.800
 So there's a phase where, and to be honest, I still do this because we don't have a bidet installed.

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:52.160
 I was like showering after every shit.

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:54.560
 How did you do like a quick like three minutes shower?

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.080
 Just lower half of my body.

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:57.120
 This is fun.

00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:57.600
 I'm glad.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:58.800
 I'm glad we're talking about this.

00:32:58.800 --> 00:32:59.440
 Fascinating.

00:32:59.440 --> 00:32:59.920
 Good time.

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:00.720
 Yeah.

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:01.600
 So really good.

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:02.640
 You guys, you have a bidet?

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:05.120
 What's your butt washing situation?

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.440
 Adam, I feel like you have a bidet.

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:10.080
 I feel like you have every fucking product Instagram advertising.

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:14.800
 We had one, we didn't use it when we got rid of it.

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:18.880
 It's like when you put on top, it was like a place to seek kind of thing.

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:19.200
 Tushy.

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:21.520
 Okay.

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:22.480
 Do you have a tushy?

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:25.440
 No, it's just like, it's such an Adam product.

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.960
 It's like, oh my God.

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:27.920
 You see it and you get it.

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:28.800
 I can see that in your house.

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:29.760
 I'm a consumer.

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:30.320
 Okay.

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:31.680
 I hope this economy go around.

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:34.080
 Prime John sharing what he's doing is private.

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:36.000
 Yeah, he's like, I talk about his bidet situation.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.520
 You know, I'm just a classic listener.

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:40.240
 I just, I use toilet paper.

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:41.440
 Just dry wipe.

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.520
 I live a fairly healthy lifestyle.

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:45.440
 So I mean, often I ghost wipe.

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:46.160
 Yeah, me too.

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:47.600
 Wait, what?

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:49.040
 Were you wiping up things, something there?

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:50.560
 That's the best.

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:51.520
 He's clean pinch.

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:52.400
 Ghost wipe.

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:53.600
 Hey, just clean pinch it.

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:57.200
 How do I never heard any of these risks?

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:58.800
 How do you not know about these things?

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.000
 I've made it into the Ozarks.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.760
 All right.

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:04.880
 Let's let's bring it back to some tech stuff.

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:09.280
 Please, yes.

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.560
 ESM was better than this.

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:12.880
 I enjoyed talking about JavaScript packages.

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:14.080
 Speaking of bud vomit.

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:14.480
 How's he?

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:21.680
 What are you learning right now?

00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:23.120
 And then you're learning actively.

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:25.440
 I mean, I've been working a lot with Astro.

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:28.720
 Like we're rewriting that muse with Astro.

00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:30.800
 So that's been fun.

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:31.680
 How is Astro?

00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:32.320
 It's good.

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:34.800
 I mean, Sammy's is like the perfect use case.

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:36.960
 It's like millions of pages.

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:39.040
 They all just grab a little data, render the page.

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:43.520
 So there's not really much client-side interactivity at all.

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:46.000
 So I think if you're doing something app-like,

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.360
 like DAX does everything as an app, not great.

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:51.200
 I think they're working on that, though, too.

00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:52.320
 Aren't they like client-side?

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:56.480
 Fred was telling me that they're building like a heavy SPA right now

00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:58.240
 on top of using Astro.

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:00.320
 So once they've released that,

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.360
 they're going to like put out,

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:02.640
 here's our learning series.

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:03.760
 Here's how you should go about it.

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:06.400
 I think I'll be willing to try it.

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:08.800
 To me, most of the stuff I build,

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:12.320
 like maybe like one or two pages would benefit from the S/SAR side,

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:17.280
 but it's like a lot to accept into my day-to-day,

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:19.120
 just for like those few pages.

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:20.480
 I tend to build a kind of SPA's.

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:24.480
 Just not for me, but for them on the marketing page side,

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:25.520
 everything else I do publicly,

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:27.520
 I've been using Astro and I love it.

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:30.000
 It's so simple and good.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:30.640
 Delightful.

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:31.200
 Delightful.

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:32.000
 What about you, Prime?

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.360
 What's Prime learning?

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:34.800
 Oh, camel.

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:35.520
 Yeah, I saw that.

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:36.560
 Is that why you posted that?

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:39.360
 You hate Russ because you finally see the glory of oh, camel?

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:40.400
 No, no, no.

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.800
 I had this great rant and it was going to make,

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:45.680
 it was going to be 100,000 view TikTok or Instagram real.

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:47.440
 Felt really confident on it.

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:49.680
 And in the middle, I did do that.

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:50.880
 That's part of, by the way,

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:56.400
 super sweet secret to like growing socials is have a semi-viral moment.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.640
 Also refer to another social you do.

00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:02.720
 Very smart move, but the thing was is that you get the,

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:04.000
 I get this all the time.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.120
 I'm sure you guys get this too.

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:06.880
 But what should I build?

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:08.080
 Oh, I have this side project.

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:08.880
 Should I choose Russ?

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:09.600
 Should I choose this?

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:10.560
 Should I choose that?

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:12.880
 And it's always the same answer, at least for me,

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:16.320
 which is stop letting people tell you what you should enjoy.

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:21.280
 Like pick the thing you really want to learn or do and do that

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:22.720
 because if you listen to me and you're like,

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:25.040
 oh, I better do Russ because Prime says Russ,

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:26.880
 you're going to take like three weeks learning it.

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:28.880
 You're going to hate your life by the end of it.

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:31.280
 You're not going to enjoy anything you've done.

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:34.400
 Sure, iterators are great, but learning Russ sucks.

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:37.680
 And so it's just like you finally get to that point of learning it all.

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:38.400
 And then you're like,

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:40.960
 I don't want to even write this project anymore.

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:42.000
 I'm not going to do this.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.840
 Am I even a talented dev?

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:46.560
 No, you just chose a really hard starting point

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:48.240
 because you listen to somebody on the internet

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:49.840
 who's been programming for 20 years.

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:50.800
 That's what happened.

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:52.640
 Okay, that's the problem.

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:55.600
 And so don't listen to everybody because here's the thing is

00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:57.280
 I can say whatever I want to say.

00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:59.040
 And if I say something that makes you think,

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:00.480
 oh, I should stop learning it,

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:03.600
 then you're like letting me have way too much influence in your life.

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:05.520
 Cue the Russ sucks tweet.

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:07.840
 I like Russ, but by me saying that,

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:10.000
 there is going to be literal people that are going to be like,

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000
 oh, I shouldn't learn Russ anymore, right?

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.360
 Which is stupid.

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:16.880
 Stop listening to people specifically shit posters

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:19.920
 for like how you should think about your life.

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:22.720
 You should do the things that make you want to wake up

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.240
 and do it again tomorrow.

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:27.040
 That is going to be your most successful path forward

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:29.360
 is being excited.

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.360
 And that's like that that's truly it.

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:34.160
 And so yeah, the whole thing was influence or suck.

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:36.640
 I myself suck.

00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:39.040
 Yeah, we talk about a lot of work where like there's like so much

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:42.480
 strategy and thinking and how do you build a business, et cetera.

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:44.720
 But the only thing that matters is that we're working on stuff

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:47.360
 we're motivated on because whoever's able to go the longest,

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:49.280
 the hardest just eventually wins.

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:54.320
 So like our only strategy is like assessing like what do we feel like working on.

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:57.280
 It might be one thing that seems like it doesn't exactly make sense

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:59.760
 from like a business or product wise.

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:03.040
 But some part of you is excited to work on that for a reason.

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:06.400
 And if you trust your judgment, like it kind of carries you long term.

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:09.760
 The other thing is this is what I always say to people

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:12.720
 when I'm like talking to them about technologies or like ideas

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:17.200
 or explaining something, I often say you're probably not going to understand this.

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:20.080
 The point of me saying this is not so you hear and you understand it.

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:22.400
 It's so later when you discover the stuff on your own,

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:25.360
 you can kind of connect the dots of like, oh, that's what he was talking about.

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:29.600
 Because I remember there were so many times in my career where I was introduced to a concept

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:32.800
 and I just wasn't at a point where I would like really internalize it.

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:35.840
 Like someone showed me functional programming, actually my dad.

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:38.400
 My dad showed me functional programming very, very, very early.

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:39.040
 That is so cool.

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:41.920
 Into my, yeah, he was like, this is really important.

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:43.200
 And he was trying to explain to me.

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:45.600
 And I was like, I barely knew anything.

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:47.120
 So they got, okay, I guess.

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:48.160
 I just didn't click for me.

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:52.000
 Three or four years later, then I got super into it.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.680
 Then I understood what he was talking about.

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.360
 It did help things to click faster.

00:38:55.360 --> 00:39:00.160
 But if I just try to dive in there and like, that was the way I tried to get into programming,

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:03.200
 it just, it just would not really have happened.

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:05.040
 It's the exact same thing with life advice, right?

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:07.600
 Like when someone says your friends lead you astray,

00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:10.320
 you should be very careful on who you spend all your time with.

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:11.920
 Like it doesn't make any sense when you're 17.

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:12.560
 Yeah.

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:15.600
 You know, I was off smoking meth when I was 17.

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:18.160
 Like I wasn't like, I didn't, I couldn't hear certain things.

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:21.120
 When people told me that waking up early and going to bed early

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:24.400
 and being super rigorous about how you live your life,

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:27.360
 that you have two wills, that you have your lower animalistic will,

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:31.840
 and you have your higher will, in which you have to fight against both these wills all the time.

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:33.840
 It's like, I couldn't hear any of those words.

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:35.680
 You could have just told me all those words and I would have been like,

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:36.720
 oh, yeah, I understand that.

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:38.880
 But really it was just like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:39.120
 Right?

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:40.160
 Yeah.

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:42.720
 The tragedy is that now that you understand that,

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:46.160
 you can't even save anyone any time because they kind of have to go through that same journey.

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.120
 That's what's so frustrating.

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:49.520
 Like your kids, whoever you're trying to like teach,

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:51.920
 you can tell them the stuff, but it's not going to save them any time.

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:55.520
 They're going to have to go through the exact same journey or like a similar journey that you went through.

00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:57.040
 And yeah.

00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:00.560
 You may be able to save them time because right once they start discovering

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:04.000
 life is harder or more complex than they realize,

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.240
 and then one of the things you've said lines up,

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:06.960
 it clicks faster.

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:10.800
 Maybe they'll just go, oh, you know, that's, I mean, that's wisdom, right?

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:12.560
 Which is, you know, what problem to solve.

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:16.160
 And so hopefully they start, you know, they can get wisdom faster.

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:18.000
 I did not get wisdom very quick.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.240
 And a lot of intelligence, absolutely no wisdom.

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:22.960
 Yeah, similar path to me to the same thing with waking up early thing.

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:27.520
 Like there was a time where I just did not understand why that mattered.

00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:28.800
 And I lived my whole life that way.

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.520
 And then at some point it clicked and I was like, you always feel like an idiot

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:33.600
 because you're like, oh, this is what they were talking about.

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:34.800
 Like, oh, this makes so much sense.

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:39.360
 But yeah, I feel like if you're, if you're not cringing at who you were five years ago,

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:41.040
 you're just not growing enough.

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:43.600
 That's gone for me.

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:45.520
 I also don't like to use the word cringing.

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:48.240
 Like, I think cringing, I was just thinking about this earlier

00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:53.280
 because I never listened to any like, I'm not really big on consuming content.

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:57.280
 But I decided to try to understand this whole kick drama with XQC.

00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:00.480
 And I'm like, I'm going to, I'm going to be like a pop culture guy for a moment

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:01.520
 and try to understand this.

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:02.080
 Okay.

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:05.440
 And I watched like four clips and one of them had pokey mane.

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:11.920
 And she just kept saying the word cringe and listening to her was the very act of cringing.

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:15.920
 And so I just realized that when someone speaks like that,

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:17.840
 there's, it's like speaking Latin.

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:20.400
 It's actually just purely a written meme.

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:24.880
 Right. When someone, when someone writes it, I feel like you can, that's fine.

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:28.000
 And you can read it, but you can't say it out loud.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.760
 And when someone's like, oh man, I'm cringing.

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:35.920
 You're like, no, ah, like I was using that word like prior to this whole thing.

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:37.040
 It doesn't matter.

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:37.520
 Okay.

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:38.080
 Yeah.

00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:40.080
 Every time I say it, that's how it goes.

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:43.040
 I feel like I learned all the words I needed to learn when I was like 14.

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:45.600
 And I just haven't really increased my vocabulary since then.

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:46.400
 It's like you don't need it.

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:47.840
 She's reading more books.

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:48.080
 That's sad.

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:49.440
 You should.

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:52.000
 I should read more books.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:52.960
 That's what you said.

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:53.200
 Yeah.

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:54.400
 Daxx has read 10 books.

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:55.360
 He's only read 10 books.

00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:56.240
 He stopped.

00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:58.880
 And then now he wonders why his vocabulary is not increasing.

00:41:58.880 --> 00:41:58.880
 Okay.

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:01.440
 So I was calculating with Liz yesterday.

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:04.160
 You know, she's read like 22 books this year already.

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:04.720
 Wow.

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:06.720
 She definitely thinks she's better than all of us.

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:07.280
 I mean, she is.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.680
 Objectively.

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:10.400
 Her vocabulary is.

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:11.920
 By the way, I checked her.

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:13.680
 I checked her audible badges.

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:17.200
 And she doesn't have the one that you have where you've checked it.

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:18.480
 The one where you keep checking back.

00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:19.040
 Yeah.

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:20.640
 Which I was like, this is actually perfect.

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:21.680
 Adam would have that.

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:23.600
 And she definitely would not have that.

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.680
 I have that one on her.

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:26.160
 Yeah.

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:27.600
 I've read zero books this year.

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:27.920
 Really?

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:30.160
 I've read two books this year.

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:31.680
 Well, actually, I've read three books.

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:34.480
 I've read or two books this year, two to three books this year.

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:35.600
 I think I've read zero.

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:36.480
 I've read a few.

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:36.720
 Yeah.

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.640
 I mean, I listened to a few.

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:39.120
 Audible.

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:40.800
 I'm about to finish my third book.

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:41.520
 Is it?

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:46.480
 So my book so far has been Wheel of Time book one, two, and now almost three.

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:47.520
 Is that sci-fi?

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:48.560
 Is it fiction?

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:49.600
 It's fantasy.

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:50.400
 Fantasy, okay.

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.760
 Yeah.

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:55.280
 So imagine just different Lord of the Rings, if you will.

00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:57.120
 I like that.

00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:57.600
 Is it good?

00:42:57.600 --> 00:42:57.760
 Yeah.

00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:58.400
 You recommend it?

00:42:58.400 --> 00:42:58.800
 Yeah.

00:42:58.800 --> 00:42:59.440
 Oh, it's great.

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:00.240
 It's great book.

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:00.720
 Great book.

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:02.720
 The writer, he's amazing.

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:05.600
 Dude, it's like 10,000 pages for the whole series.

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:08.480
 And so I'm on book three.

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:09.200
 I read to my kids.

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:12.560
 I refuse to let my kids read kids stories because kids stories are stupid

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:13.840
 and they're just one dimensional.

00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:18.160
 And so it's like, I want my kids to have to like carry a few characters

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:22.080
 for days as opposed to being like, the dog goes wolf.

00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:23.360
 The wolf goes wolf.

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:24.720
 Like, no, no, no, no, no.

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:27.040
 Like, I don't care that A told B and B told C,

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:28.400
 I'll meet you at the top of the coke that tree.

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:29.440
 Like, we're just not doing that.

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:30.400
 That's for a baby.

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:31.680
 Okay, that's for a baby.

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:32.720
 I'm reading a real book.

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:34.960
 So we read through Lord of the Rings.

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.000
 They loved it.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.600
 We read through The Hobbit.

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:38.560
 They loved it, right?

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:40.400
 The Hobbit is kind of like meant to be a kid's book

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:41.200
 and originally, right?

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:42.480
 It's like a nice bounce me too.

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:43.600
 Yeah, so, yeah.

00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:45.360
 And so then we went through Wheel of Time.

00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:46.320
 They loved Wheel of Time.

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:47.040
 It's a great book.

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:47.840
 The Midrials.

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:50.960
 They know Neneve, Eglyn, Elaine.

00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:52.480
 They're like, they have everyone, Matt,

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:54.320
 Perrin, Rand, Maureen, Land, right?

00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:56.720
 Like, they have like 12, 15 characters and they're loving it.

00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:58.480
 You know, Dax and I haven't read it.

00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:00.000
 We don't know any of those characters.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.400
 I'm saying a lot of names so that you go, oh, wow.

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:05.120
 Oh, that they carry all of this, yeah.

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:06.000
 So you keep this on the head.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.280
 Like 12 characters in there.

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:08.160
 Yeah.

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:09.440
 So why limit them?

00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:11.440
 Why make them have to have dumb stories

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:15.280
 that don't challenge them at all or make them have to keep on going?

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:17.280
 And by the way, TJ, who's in your chat,

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:21.040
 sat in the room while I read, I think, book two to my kids.

00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:22.640
 Because he was over at my house a while back.

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:24.560
 So you read to him also?

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:27.520
 Yeah, because he's like, I like Wheel of Time.

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:32.000
 You have six kids?

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:32.640
 No, I have four.

00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:34.320
 Four?

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:35.520
 Why do I think you have six kids?

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:37.360
 I'm not a happy Mormon family, okay?

00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:38.960
 Dax, why did you think you had six kids?

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:39.600
 Six just now.

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:41.840
 I was like, whoa, yes, six kids.

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:43.920
 Can I talk about something deep while we're talking about kids?

00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:47.040
 This is like, I don't have a lot of deep thoughts

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:48.160
 when I have one, I want to share it.

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:53.120
 So my biggest fear, like, easily, biggest fear in life,

00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:55.200
 is like, I've loved what I do.

00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:56.800
 Like, I love programming.

00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:59.440
 I love my job, just everything I've done in my career.

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:02.240
 And my biggest fear is that my kids won't love what they do.

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:06.240
 Like, that they won't find whatever it is for them.

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:08.000
 Because most of my family has it.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.400
 I mean, most people I know don't love what they do.

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:11.360
 Most people don't love what they do.

00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:12.400
 Yeah, it feels pretty rare.

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:13.840
 It's a rarity to love what you do.

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:15.440
 And now that I'm saying it out loud,

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:18.240
 is the answer, I feel like Prime's answer to this is like,

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:19.280
 that it's a you problem.

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:21.040
 Like, you can love whatever you do.

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:23.360
 It's not like a magical, is that what you would say?

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.760
 No, I wouldn't say you can love whatever you do,

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:27.760
 because I don't think it's possible to love all things.

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:31.360
 But this is my fundamental theory.

00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:34.400
 Work is meant to satisfy.

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:39.760
 It's not meant to be your identity or where your value is driven from.

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:41.440
 And I think there's a problem.

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:43.200
 Because even like in the most idyllic world,

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:45.760
 old writings, all that, even in the Garden of Eden,

00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:46.800
 Adam and Eve worked, right?

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:47.360
 They're working.

00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:49.280
 Like, work is a universal concept.

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:51.760
 That's like, here's something that everyone at all points,

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:56.160
 even in the perfect world, even in a theoretically perfect world, did.

00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:57.760
 So therefore, there's something about work

00:45:57.760 --> 00:45:59.280
 that is fundamental to human nature.

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:04.160
 But the moment that you make it more than what it is,

00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:05.200
 you ruin it, right?

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:09.920
 Anything can be, if you make your kids the meaning of your life,

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:11.760
 you can ruin them.

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:12.880
 You can ruin yourself.

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:16.400
 You can greatly make them dysfunctional due to your actions, right?

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:19.600
 Like, overvaluing something is bad.

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:21.840
 And so I think work has been largely overvalued.

00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:23.360
 And it's who you are.

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:26.160
 Me, me personally, so I just get satisfied with what I do.

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:28.880
 I mean, me and Liz don't have kids when we do talk about this concept,

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:30.560
 where I think it's less about the work.

00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:34.800
 And I can just get really passionate into things that I am doing.

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:38.480
 And I think the only fear that I have is I'll have a kid

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:42.800
 that's unable to find that curiosity or intensity for anything.

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:45.120
 I would find that very hard to relate to.

00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:47.440
 So it doesn't have to be literally work,

00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:50.000
 but it can be like anything potentially.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:50.880
 There's a lot of things out there.

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:52.080
 I feel like for most people,

00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:54.080
 there is something that they can get that excited about.

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:57.440
 But I do know people that just kind of are like,

00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:58.800
 nod that into really anything.

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:02.240
 And I just, I have a hard time relating to something like that,

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:03.200
 because I'm pretty different.

00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:04.960
 I get into literally everything.

00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:06.560
 All right, I'm going to read you my biggest fear

00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:07.920
 since we're on this biggest fear thing.

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:08.480
 Are you ready?

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:08.960
 Yes.

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:09.120
 All right.

00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:12.400
 So have you heard the song Cats in the Cradle with the Silverstone?

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:13.200
 Yes, sure.

00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:13.600
 All right.

00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:15.840
 So I'm going to just read a couple excerpts.

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:16.400
 All right.

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:18.240
 My son turned 10 just the other day.

00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:20.080
 He said, thanks for the ball, dad.

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:20.960
 Come, let's play.

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:22.640
 Can you teach me to throw?

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:24.400
 I said, hey, not today.

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:25.440
 I got a lot to do.

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:26.880
 He said, that's OK.

00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:30.480
 And he, he walked away, but his smile never dimmed.

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:32.320
 It said, I'm going to be like him.

00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:34.480
 Yeah, you know I'm going to be like him.

00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:35.120
 Next section.

00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:37.200
 Go all the way down here.

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:38.480
 I've long since retired.

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:39.520
 My sons moved away.

00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:41.120
 I called him up just the other day.

00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:42.400
 I said, I'd like to see you.

00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:43.520
 If you don't mind.

00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:44.800
 He said, I'd love to do that.

00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:45.920
 Oh, hold on.

00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:47.360
 Oh, I'm going to.

00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:50.480
 Oh, I did not know this was in the song.

00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:51.760
 OK, I'm trying to calm down.

00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:53.520
 This is like my biggest fear, right?

00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:53.920
 Yeah.

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:54.240
 Let's see.

00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:54.800
 Hey, let's see.

00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:55.280
 I'd love to.

00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:56.240
 I'd love to, dad.

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:58.720
 If I can find the time, you see my new job's a hassle,

00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:00.080
 and the kids have the flu.

00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:01.600
 But it's sure nice talking to you, dad.

00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:03.760
 It's been sure nice talking to you.

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:04.720
 As let's see.

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:06.560
 And as I hung up the phone, it occurred to me.

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:08.320
 He's grown up just like me.

00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:09.040
 My voice.

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:09.520
 Ooh.

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:12.240
 That's tough.

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:15.600
 Which, which, are you afraid that that's going to,

00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:17.280
 you're going to be the father in that situation?

00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:18.720
 I don't want to be the father.

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:19.200
 You know what I mean?

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:22.720
 I don't want to raise a kid who doesn't, you know,

00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:26.720
 like, he loved me, but I never quite love him.

00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:30.720
 Because I valued things disproportionately.

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:31.520
 Yep.

00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:32.000
 Sorry.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:32.320
 No.

00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:33.840
 I didn't realize it was going to hit me like that.

00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:37.680
 But I get just like, ugh.

00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:38.320
 Dang it.

00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:39.920
 I don't want to be on tweets like this.

00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:40.720
 OK, nothing.

00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:41.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:42.720
 It's a stax.

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:43.440
 It's a stax.

00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:43.920
 It's too much.

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:44.320
 You're good.

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:46.880
 It's a lovely just abs going up right now.

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:49.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:51.040
 Lucky man right now.

00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:52.880
 No, I mean, I didn't even know it was in the song.

00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:54.960
 I only like know the hook.

00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:56.560
 Yeah, I had no idea.

00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:58.400
 Yeah, the song is like super deep.

00:48:58.400 --> 00:48:59.360
 Yeah.

00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:00.240
 And terrifying.

00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:01.520
 Yeah.

00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:04.160
 That's kid stuff.

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:06.320
 Kid stuff's hard to actually find out.

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:07.680
 When are you guys having a kid?

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:09.520
 Well, let's get that going.

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:12.240
 Very soon, realistically.

00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:14.320
 Like, we were actually just talking about it yesterday.

00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:16.080
 I think we're both pretty ready.

00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:18.400
 We used to get a few practical things

00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:20.960
 in order over the next couple of months or so,

00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:23.520
 and then probably start then.

00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:24.880
 When did you guys have your first kids?

00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:26.000
 Adam, you were really young, right?

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.200
 I'm doing the math.

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:29.280
 No, we got married at 20 and 22,

00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:32.720
 but we didn't have kids until 26 and 28.

00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:33.360
 Is that right?

00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:35.280
 Yeah, 26 and 28.

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:39.120
 OK, wife was 24 when I was 27 when we had her first kid.

00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:41.360
 Yeah, in a lot of ways we wish that we were able to do it

00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:42.240
 like three years ago.

00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:43.200
 I know it would have been ideal.

00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:45.280
 Just because the age I'm going to be

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:48.000
 when they're adults, I want to be able to be like--

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.600
 I mean, three years isn't a huge deal,

00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:52.960
 but yeah, I think the window is like where you guys had it.

00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:54.800
 It would have been a lot more ideal, but--

00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:57.680
 But it's nice being married for a little while before you have--

00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:59.840
 you kind of have this unique chapter.

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:01.280
 Like, we were married six years.

00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:01.840
 That's true.

00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:02.240
 I don't know.

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:04.320
 We're very thankful for those six years.

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:06.320
 And then it's just a whole different life.

00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:08.240
 Feels like, totally different life.

00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:08.800
 Yeah.

00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:09.520
 Yeah.

00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:11.520
 I think you should have kids as quick as possible.

00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:12.640
 That's me personally.

00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:14.400
 Jump off the cliff, right?

00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:15.680
 You can't-- you know what?

00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:18.320
 You can't prepare emotionally enough

00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:19.600
 to be able to jump off a cliff.

00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:20.880
 You just have to jump off the cliff.

00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:22.560
 There's definitely no preparing for it.

00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:23.120
 Yeah.

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:24.960
 There's nothing you can do to be ready for it.

00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:25.200
 Yeah.

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:26.640
 We got a dog first.

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:29.520
 So we're scaffolding.

00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:31.600
 We had a dog when we had our first kid,

00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:34.240
 and the dog now is with my parents.

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:34.720
 So--

00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:36.640
 When you don't have kids and you have a dog,

00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:37.760
 you go, oh, look.

00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:40.720
 I just got care so much about this dog and all this.

00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:42.000
 All the pictures of it.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.480
 And then all of a sudden, you're just like, who?

00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:45.440
 Oh, yeah.

00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:45.920
 Yeah.

00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:47.280
 In the-- in the grave.

00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:48.880
 I was like, that's not on the head.

00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:49.920
 That was great.

00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:51.040
 I was like, that's not-- like, that's--

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:55.120
 you realize that you are capable of so much more caring.

00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:58.240
 You just haven't unlocked that level yet.

00:50:58.240 --> 00:50:58.720
 Yep.

00:50:58.720 --> 00:50:59.040
 Yeah.

00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:00.240
 This is the Elden Ring reference.

00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:02.960
 Trade in those runes, and you got to up level that.

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:05.040
 And you just don't know caring has more levels.

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:06.800
 And then it turns out it even has more levels

00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:07.440
 than you realize.

00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:08.400
 And every time you have a kid--

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:08.960
 No, I believe it.

00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:12.080
 It's like every-- it just shows you how much more capacity

00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:13.440
 you have every single time.

00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:14.880
 It's always surprising.

00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:16.240
 The thing with the-- again, the thing

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:18.640
 the thing you were reading.

00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:20.800
 Do you think your kids will move away?

00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:22.160
 That's what always makes it hard.

00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:23.600
 Because my family--

00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:24.800
 I moved away.

00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:26.000
 I live in-- now Miami.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:27.920
 My family's in New Jersey.

00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:30.960
 It just makes that whole thing pretty much guaranteed

00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:32.080
 at that point.

00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:34.720
 I think if you're in a city, it's kind of like--

00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:35.040
 I don't know.

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:37.360
 It feels natural.

00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:39.760
 But I feel like if-- because you don't really--

00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:40.320
 I don't know.

00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:43.920
 It's hard for me to find a home in a city.

00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:46.960
 If that makes sense, it's hard to feel home.

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:49.840
 It depends on a city, though, because here nobody leaves.

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:51.840
 Like Liz, we moved here because my wife

00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:53.520
 has 100 family members here.

00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:54.240
 Nobody leaves.

00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:55.760
 Culturally, nobody leaves.

00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:57.200
 Pretty much people live with their parents

00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:01.600
 till they get married, and they move out 20 minutes away.

00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:04.320
 I really like that because people have roots here.

00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:06.560
 I think when I was in New York, everyone you met.

00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:09.280
 It's going to be gone in 10 years.

00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:12.400
 And we all know that we're not going to be here forever.

00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:15.520
 There's this temporary vibe to everything.

00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:18.000
 Whereas here, I'll meet someone, and it's like--

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.400
 they have-- their grandparents have been here forever,

00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:21.920
 and their network is massive.

00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:23.680
 And you just meet so many people that have been here,

00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:24.400
 and there's roots.

00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:26.560
 And everyone kind of knows each other through that.

00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:28.080
 I really like that.

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:30.240
 And it's a nice balance with it still being--

00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:32.080
 with some of the benefits of the city.

00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:34.240
 But yeah, any other city I've been in

00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:36.560
 has just not been like that.

00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:38.000
 Yeah, that was my same vibe, which

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.120
 is that's why I find it so hard to be home in a city,

00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:42.440
 is that I've only been in San Jose.

00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:44.480
 San Jose was the biggest place I ever lived.

00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:48.320
 And it's just like everyone you meet there will be gone shortly.

00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:49.320
 Yeah.

00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:51.800
 Nobody that you meet there grew up there.

00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:55.240
 I met like three people that grew up in San Jose.

00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:58.000
 And I was very, very few people grew up in the Bay Area.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:59.400
 It was all transient.

00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:00.240
 Everyone comes in.

00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:01.160
 They all come in.

00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:01.800
 They all go.

00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:04.720
 You just have no permanence in some sense there.

00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:07.240
 It's just like a very-- you come.

00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:08.240
 You consume.

00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:09.280
 You leave.

00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:11.920
 Whereas in South Dakota, it's just different.

00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:13.200
 People, there's families here.

00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:15.840
 I just went on a hike with a guy whose--

00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:19.040
 their family owned half of Rapid City at one point.

00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:21.320
 And he went and showed me this cool spot.

00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:22.600
 He's 92 years old.

00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:23.640
 And we went hiking.

00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:25.760
 And we drove through these private properties.

00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:27.680
 And he's like, I know those people,

00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:30.600
 because my mother used to teach there.

00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:33.560
 But I was just like, we go to this special spot

00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:35.320
 that's super hard to get to, because you'd

00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:37.520
 have to walk for miles in federal land,

00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:40.880
 or you can walk like a mile and just do it

00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:42.040
 through all this private property.

00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:43.280
 It was super cool.

00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:46.400
 And it's just like these are like the rare things you get to do.

00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:49.400
 And everyone there has been there forever.

00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:52.320
 And it just feels like you can establish like a home feeling.

00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:52.920
 Yeah, yeah.

00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:54.240
 I was definitely craving that.

00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:55.960
 At least for me, I got to a certain age.

00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:58.560
 And that was like extremely what I wanted.

00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:01.840
 It was impossible where I was living.

00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:03.920
 How old were you left to San Jose?

00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:08.720
 So I moved to San Jose at 27, four weeks before I had my first kid.

00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:11.240
 And we left San Jose, the day Gavin Newsom

00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:12.640
 announced lockdowns for COVID.

00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:15.120
 Oh, nice timing.

00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:16.520
 Yeah, yeah.

00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:17.800
 Was that coincidence?

00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:22.240
 No, it was a motivator, because we didn't want to be there.

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:24.520
 It's like, hey, everybody, how would you

00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:28.040
 like to have three kids and we lived next door to a park

00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:29.640
 and police were driving around?

00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:34.720
 Like roughing people up who left to go walk around the park.

00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:37.960
 And so it's just like, OK, I'd rather live in South Dakota

00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:39.560
 where there's just like land.

00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:42.600
 No one lives there, you know, they say no one lives there.

00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:44.320
 There's enough people to live there, but you can have space.

00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:45.080
 You can walk around.

00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:49.120
 I can like not be confined in a house with two laver doors

00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:53.280
 and three kids and a beautiful wife in 1800 square feet

00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:54.600
 and just be there for the next two months.

00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:55.320
 Like that'd be crazy.

00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:55.840
 I'd go nuts.

00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:56.800
 I personally would just go nuts.

00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:59.360
 So I just was like, we got to get out of here.

00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:00.200
 Just saying it.

00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:02.240
 Yeah, why South Dakota?

00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:03.640
 Are you guys from there?

00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:05.560
 My wife's family grew up in South Dakota.

00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:07.680
 So they're like multiple generation people,

00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:09.080
 just like the Miami story had.

00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:10.800
 Yeah, it's something I've never had.

00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:13.320
 There's like a giant family and it's super nice.

00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:17.600
 They're just like a default set of things you get to do,

00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:19.400
 especially when we move, because we're like,

00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:22.040
 when we were going to have kids, like having kids

00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:24.880
 in the city by yourself is very difficult

00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:28.760
 and having like the family support is really useful.

00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:30.000
 They want all the help we can get.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:31.840
 Yeah, having kids in the country by yourself

00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:33.080
 is also really difficult.

00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:35.960
 Just having kids is really difficult.

00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:37.200
 It's really great though.

00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:40.480
 I feel like we've said it all.

00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:42.480
 Yeah, Prime, you've said it all.

00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:42.920
 Thank you.

00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:44.640
 I've been known to talk.

00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:46.440
 No, our editor is very good.

00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:47.800
 You will cut this up well.

00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:49.800
 Yeah, is your editor Adam?

00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:52.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.200
 Our editor's pretty great.

00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:55.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:59.000
 No, we have just talked a lot, and Chris has always

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.920
 found a way to magically put it in a way that was cohesive.

00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:02.440
 OK.

00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:04.440
 Well, neither of us have listened to the final product.

00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:05.760
 So do we know that, Dax?

00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:06.280
 Is it cohesive?

00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:06.800
 That's not true.

00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:08.800
 Remember that one time I listened to like three episodes?

00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:09.320
 We did.

00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:09.840
 Yeah, you did this.

00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:10.800
 Because I was a little in the card,

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:13.240
 but this is the only time that I can listen to our podcast.

00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:14.600
 Because if anyone ever hears me doing it,

00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:15.800
 it's going to make fun of me.

00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:16.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:17.560
 Yeah, that's weird.

00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:20.560
 I literally don't like to listen to my own-- I never--

00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:21.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.720
 Do you ever watch like your own YouTube videos or--

00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:25.280
 No, my entire side channel, I haven't

00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:26.160
 watched a single one.

00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:27.960
 Or maybe I've watched one.

00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:30.360
 I have 170 videos on there, and I haven't watched one.

00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:31.920
 Wow.

00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:33.960
 So the idea with that one is just like, you literally

00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:34.480
 don't have to do it.

00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:36.000
 You just cut out parts of your stream.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.920
 Like, flip, just cuts it up.

00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:38.360
 Yeah.

00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:39.120
 Yeah.

00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:41.720
 Just off-- it's just whatever you say on stream.

00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:42.400
 Whatever I say.

00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:43.640
 And you know, sometimes I feel like I'm

00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:46.680
 going to get in trouble with it, but we'll see what happens.

00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:48.080
 Hey, I mean, you still have your job.

00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:49.880
 That's impressive with everything.

00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:51.080
 I still have a job.

00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:52.080
 Thank you.

00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:54.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:56.720
 All right, I got to pee again, and I got to go.

00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:57.720
 Thank you so much.

00:56:57.720 --> 00:56:58.560
 Thanks for coming.

00:56:58.560 --> 00:56:59.400
 I got to make some motion.

00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:00.600
 Yeah, go stream.

00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:01.160
 Go do that.

00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:01.660
 Bye.

00:57:01.660 --> 00:57:02.120
 So yeah.

00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:03.520
 I feel like we didn't even introduce Prime.

00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:05.160
 We just kind of like started talking.

00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:05.600
 That's true.

00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:06.100
 We did.

00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:07.100
 Do we need to make an introduction for it?

00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:08.040
 Do you want to do it in directions?

00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:08.600
 Ooh, let's do it.

00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:09.720
 Yeah, after the fact.

00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:12.080
 Let's pretend like he's still here.

00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:12.960
 Oh, God.

00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:14.200
 I'm going to be so bad at it.

00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:15.920
 You will do like a very professional job.

00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:16.600
 Could you please do it?

00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:18.720
 No, because last time we tried, I did the bad job.

00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:19.480
 We can do the good job.

00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:20.400
 Did you do the bad job?

00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:25.640
 Would you try to introduce teach and you did a bad job?

00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:27.680
 So today we've got a special guest.

00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:29.240
 The primegens here.

00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:31.240
 The primegens works at Netflix.

00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:33.000
 But what am I going to say?

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:33.920
 Don't use that, Chris.

00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:34.560
 That was terrible.

00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:35.060
 Never mind.

00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:35.560
 No introduction.

00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:37.320
 That was a bad idea.

00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:37.920
 It was terrible.

00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:40.520
 It was bad.

00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:41.360
 It's the fixed hair.

00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:43.800
 I fixed my hair, and then I try and say things all serious.

00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:44.320
 No.

00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:45.240
 Just no.

00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:45.880
 We're just going to go.

00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:48.720
 It's just going to be straight into whatever we were saying.

00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:50.480
 I have no idea what we just talked about.

00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:51.240
 Me neither.

00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:52.400
 Can I roll over the place?

00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:53.160
 Cool.

00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:54.840
 I'm going to stop the recording now.

00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:55.720
 Good luck, Chris.

00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:56.280
 Godspeed.

00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:56.800
 Godspeed.

00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:59.800
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:16.120
 This is a strange podcast.
