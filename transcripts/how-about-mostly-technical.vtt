00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160
 No, Dax is going to go crazy on Shibuya.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.480
 No, but here's the thing though, I am going on vacation.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.920
 Sorry, Liz. They shut something. Got a few, babe.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.720
 You know, she literally told me she was like, "No, funny with Purcell on vacation."

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.440
 I don't know if she knows you very well. I know y'all are married or whatever, but...

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.040
 Ah, what happened?

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.240
 Camera says.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:45.680
 What a... What a weekend.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.680
 Lots to come here.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.240
 Big weekend on Twitter.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.120
 I know. Great timing for this.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.640
 Let's just start. I don't... You guys have backgrounds.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.120
 You got into computers at some point. Nobody cares about that.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.040
 Let's just start.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.160
 I mean, everybody knows who you guys are.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.480
 So, welcome to the show. Thank you for being here.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.240
 Super exciting.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.240
 Do you want to talk about Laravelle JavaScript?

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.640
 Want to talk about your selling coffee out of terminal, Adam's working on a course.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.440
 Nobody knows what SST is. It's going to have to be a show.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.120
 SST is, yes! I have no idea!

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.920
 Yes, let me tell you, this is the funniest thing.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.280
 I love Dax's Twitter persona, okay?

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.440
 And I have actively not figured out what the fuck he's doing.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.600
 Like, I don't know what SST is.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.680
 Like, I don't know... I don't really understand if you work there, Dax, or you own it,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.360
 or even how it makes money.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.000
 Like, I don't want to know anything about it, because I just love your vibe.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.320
 And I'm like, if I know too much, it's going to mess it up.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.920
 Like, I don't want to know anything about it.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.200
 It's some JavaScript-y, AWS stuff. Good.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.920
 I just leave it there. So, I'll probably learn more today, but...

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.840
 It's funny, because that's...

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.440
 I hear that this is so much.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.000
 It's like, I think our marketing is really good in terms of people,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.280
 like, hearing the literal name, but it just doesn't go further than that.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.160
 Like, I was like, I've heard of this, and I think I'm supposed to say it's good,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.520
 but like, I don't know what it is, or what the point is, or I'm never looking into it.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.960
 So, very common situation.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.880
 It seems to tie into the jaw.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.200
 As soon as I see, like, next JS, I just, like...

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.560
 I just, you know, block out, and I just, like, don't go bothering that.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.120
 So...

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.680
 Yeah, me too.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.120
 All your code snippets are awesome.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.240
 So, I'm like, oh, man, look at it.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.800
 Like, he's deploying AWS stuff with, like, one line of code.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.840
 This is amazing.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.960
 That would be cool.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.600
 Like, I should investigate, but I'm not going to.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.760
 Well, I'm not going to, because I don't want to ruin the vibe.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.920
 I also have this question.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.040
 SST, you work there, right?

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.880
 They pay you. This is your job.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.280
 It's not just, like, three friends working on an open source thing, right?

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.080
 Yeah, it's funny, because I guess, yeah.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.800
 Ultimately, like, we are three friends working on a thing.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.160
 And I guess we come off a certain way.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.840
 But people always surprised to know that we're a YC company.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.040
 We are venture-funded, like, you know, by Sirius VCs.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.200
 We're a very serious business, you know, with grown-up serious stuff, like money and things.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.840
 But it's a type of client.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.880
 Yeah.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.640
 I've never compensated a little bit.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.000
 You just, like, went way too hard.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.440
 No, it's serious.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.240
 It's very serious.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.000
 No, it's really, it's definitely real.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.120
 You don't have to posture.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.520
 I'm sorry.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.080
 We know it.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.120
 We have to go for sure.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.280
 I mean, I only say that to contrast with

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.800
 this is the type of company we wanted to build.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.360
 You know, even though it's, it is those things.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.560
 Like, we just want to stay three friends having fun.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.200
 That's why, like, you know,

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.760
 our tone is, is what it is.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.240
 Yeah.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.880
 That's awesome.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.480
 I love the two-pounder thing about that.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.920
 I did not know you were a YC backed.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.600
 I did not know you were a venture backed.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.080
 That is, that is very much news to me.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.320
 So I didn't know the venture backed part.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.080
 I didn't know YC, but I didn't know the venture backed.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.440
 Oh, yeah, I assumed it.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.160
 But I figured the money was coming in somewhere, somehow.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.800
 I had a tweet a while ago where whenever people find out that we're a YC company,

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.640
 they're always like, really?

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.280
 You guys?

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.320
 Like, I was so surprised.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.560
 And I'm like, at some point, I just are being offended, I think.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.000
 We're breaking the mold here, you know?

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.520
 But otherwise, you guys are certain, certain style, you know?

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.440
 You guys have a little different tact to it.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.760
 Yeah.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.320
 Which is good.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.760
 And in terms of money, the company's history is a little weird.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:37.280
 So I joined the team three years ago, but it had been around a little bit before then,

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.480
 with a completely different product.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.920
 And that product still makes money to this day.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.480
 It just, we haven't, like, touched it in, in several years.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.920
 Oh, really?

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:51.280
 Reason being is just the space that's in, we saw like a ceiling with it.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.120
 So we needed to pivot to something else.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.840
 And it's still related.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:00.160
 Like the other tool was a CI tool for companies in the serverless space.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.840
 It just oriented around a certain framework that wasn't really growing.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:04.960
 So we have to just do our own.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.600
 That's such a nice way of putting that.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.960
 Wasn't really growing.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:09.680
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.440
 What's the rep, who were we talking about here?

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.200
 The serverless framework.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.600
 They are the most confusing framework ever because they own serverless.com.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.160
 So when I was first like trying to learn, okay, what the hell is serverless?

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.400
 I kept landing on serverless.com.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.120
 And I was like, is this like the concept or is this like a specific framework?

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.760
 So they just had great domain position.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.720
 Great domain.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.840
 That's a great domain.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.280
 Nothing better than a great domain.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.160
 Oh, man.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.600
 That's the top of my list.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.840
 So they were, they actually, I would say made it as a framework.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.680
 They grew to a pretty large like usage base.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:53.280
 Enough so that our previous product could make money just serving people in that ecosystem.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:59.040
 But they just kind of went sideways after a certain point.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.360
 And if they're not, if they're not hyper growing, we won't either.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.440
 So that's why eventually we said, okay, we need to do our own framework.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.560
 There needs to be an angle for us that like, you can't just decide to start a framework.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.280
 You need some kind of hook.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.320
 So eventually found that and we started our own thing.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.120
 And that's what we've been working on for the past three years.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:23.200
 And our new products are oriented around our own framework and it's growing that way.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.800
 Cool.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.240
 You guys have an actual product like, is there a product for sale yet or not yet?

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.120
 Yeah.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:36.240
 So, so the new, the new framework we started three years ago, we're on like,

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.400
 it's just been a lot of exploration and figuring out like what exactly we should do.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:46.080
 The newest version of it, which we're calling ion is like, that's like our like,

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.920
 we don't have any better ideas now.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.160
 We've kind of went through the years, made our mistakes,

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.120
 figured out exactly what we need to do.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.120
 And this is like our really like our final bet.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.680
 And it kind of fixes all the problems we had in the past couple of years.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.720
 We do have another product that's the console,

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:05.600
 which is an optional thing that people using the framework can use alongside once they're in

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.320
 production. It's pretty small, surface area wise.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.760
 So there's a lot more that we need to do for.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.560
 We're actually working a lot on it this, this week and the next week.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.800
 But it's just a classic open source situation.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.360
 You just need to build two really good products on the open source one and one.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.360
 That works with it.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.680
 So yeah, it's a lot of work.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.160
 It's a work.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:24.480
 Yeah.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.360
 But a lot of it works on a people.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.000
 That's great.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:28.240
 Yeah.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.880
 That might go in front of a lot of people on Twitter.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.000
 That part's so great.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.480
 Your question is, I'm not right.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:36.960
 That's your day.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:44.080
 I set my team to screen screenshots because I had some tweet where I use the word idiots

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.120
 in my in the tweet.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:51.200
 And someone was like quote to it being like, oh, like someone was upset.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.040
 Seem seemingly upset by it.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:57.040
 And they also replied to me and I just replied to them with the word idiot without saying anything else.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.400
 And then they followed me.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.120
 So here's the thing, the people a lot.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.320
 This is what I've learned.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.400
 No, this is what they want.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.600
 I love having been an errand on the same podcast here.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:17.200
 This is like, can we, can we just, can we talk about the time where Dax was the meanest person

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.600
 in the world to me specifically?

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.200
 No, wait, what?

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.840
 Oh, yeah, this is a good one.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.560
 This is like, of course he does.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.600
 This was one of his best.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.080
 This was thermonuclear destruction.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.920
 I had just gotten laid off, just gotten laid off.

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.600
 I thought it was that long ago.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.720
 It's not even that long ago.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.520
 I got a million kids.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.200
 I got like four diseases now.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.400
 I just got laid off.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:48.720
 And I'm seeing, I'm, you know, hanging out on Twitter unemployed trying to like, you know,

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.960
 scroung up some food in the street for my family.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.560
 And I'm like, all right, Dax has a tweet.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.320
 I'm going to reply and I'm going to be snarky.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:59.120
 Dax says something like, oh, we're working on something that nobody knows about.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:04.240
 If you beg me, I'll release it tomorrow or I'll release it today or something like that.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.800
 And I just responded and said, no, I'm good.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:07.280
 I'll wait.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:14.800
 Dax responds and says, oh, I'm sure you're tired of begging people to hire you at this point, huh?

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:18.400
 And just like from outer space, nuclear warhead.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.840
 Everybody's like, whoa, dude.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:27.440
 I think, I think Jay responded with the ref giving a red card with somebody else.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.800
 Yeah, it was just like, oh, guy got a log off, man.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.800
 That was brutal.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.720
 I think at some point, you know, everyone has intrusive thoughts to enter their head.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.200
 They're like, you're like staying there, gross use to argument.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.840
 It's like, what if I just smacked the person in front of me on the head or something?

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:47.680
 That started happening to me with words.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.560
 And then at some point, I was like, I just have to say it.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.800
 So now I'm going to just have thought I just have to do it.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.880
 I have no control anymore.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.080
 So I'm sorry for the cast of me.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.960
 Yeah, I can't cosign that strategy, but I'm happy it's working.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:01.920
 It's not a strategy.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:07.280
 It's just like a maybe a disease or something, disorder.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.640
 World needs all type, you know, got to cover all the bases.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:15.120
 I feel like Adam is waffling on what he wants his online persona to be.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.320
 What's the story, Adam?

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:21.440
 I think my default is to be an errand, but I become whoever I hang out with.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.720
 And I hang out with Dax a lot.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.400
 And I think that's pulling me.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:28.320
 It's pulling me towards this kind of like hateful, spiteful person.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.600
 Yeah, I don't love it.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.720
 Yeah, yeah.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.480
 Wow.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.680
 And I'm a midwesterner.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:34.240
 So I don't know.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.280
 I don't know if it's actually that.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.880
 No, I think Dax is we've talked about this a lot.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.680
 It's like the East Coast versus West Coast thing.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.200
 Like East Coast is going on.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.960
 But he's actually more cut.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.320
 Yeah, this is his way of being kind and polite.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.120
 Like I get it.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.280
 This is the East Coast.

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:54.080
 Just another reason why I don't like New York City,

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.160
 because people think being mean is being nice.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.520
 It makes no sense to me.

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.480
 I don't like New York either.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:58.880
 I'm teary.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:10:59.520
 Thank you.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.040
 Oh, what are these things?

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.360
 I wish people people talking online about

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.680
 YouTube fighting about New York.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.040
 What's the deal with that?

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.000
 Objectively, New York is terrible.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.040
 And Ian loves it.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.000
 That's basically.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.200
 I mean, the errand has been to Times Square.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:15.840
 And then that's it.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:16.400
 Exactly.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.240
 I went to TV.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:18.720
 I went to TV.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.960
 He's like, there was a naked guy there.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.160
 And it was dirty.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:27.120
 Listen, I ain't got a sparrows and a Burger King,

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.800
 and the food is terrible.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.720
 Like, that's the whole analysis he's given to me.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.360
 No, first of all, naked is fine.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.520
 Naked and pooping is worse.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.600
 And it wasn't a sparrow.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.480
 It was a chipotle at the bottom of the Empire State Building.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.920
 And I took it back to my room and ate it in the hotel.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.600
 Oh, this is your story.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.160
 We got it.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:46.960
 Literally true.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.400
 Ian, do you live in New York?

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.600
 I live an hour north in New York.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.040
 Suburb, she lives in the suburbs.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.560
 I live in the suburbs, yes.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:55.520
 Yeah, that's true.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.920
 Well, we have to all go and fix errands.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.000
 And I think Adam's perspective on it.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.120
 There's just no way that someone could truly hate New York.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.160
 It just feels impossible.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:04.720
 It's impossible.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.280
 No, there's no way you could actually enjoy New York.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.120
 I think people cope with New York.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.000
 They tolerate it.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.840
 It's just everybody has a different tolerance.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:12.800
 There's no way you can enjoy it.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.800
 My soul hates New York so much.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.320
 And I've been there like a dozen times.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.960
 So it's not like a vindication.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.160
 I just can't imagine that other human beings actually enjoy it.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.600
 That's how I feel about dark place.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.400
 It's the best place.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.040
 I also just feel like your business will be more successful

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:27.760
 if you're in New York.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.680
 Like, I wish I'd moved to New York City.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.520
 I feel like I would be even more successful.

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:32.320
 Just living there.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.120
 You got the energy of the city, all the people, the business.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.480
 Yeah, we did.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:42.080
 You didn't move there because you know the cost is too high, Ian.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.920
 The emotional cost is too high.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.200
 The actual cost is too high.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.320
 The actual cost.

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.520
 I lived in the city for 11 or 12 years.

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.320
 That's pretty much my entire adult life.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.560
 It's like, I just keep moving in places that people hate.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:58.240
 But again, it's just because they only go to the Times Square

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.440
 or the Times Square equivalent.

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.480
 I'm convinced.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:03.920
 By the way, I know that New York is dirty.

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.920
 The entire time I lived there, though, I just was blind to it.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:08.800
 I didn't.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.400
 I was just everyone's like, it's so dirty.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.400
 I just did not see it at all.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.200
 Exactly.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.480
 It's not that dirty.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.840
 I think city scale, other big cities, way dirtier than New York.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:18.400
 Way dirtier.

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.280
 And for much like the percentage of New York,

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:25.680
 that's like either bad or dirty or whatever, is much smaller than other cities.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.480
 It's like every other city you go to, it's like, okay, you got two blocks,

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:32.160
 where it's nice and a little two block zone and everything else is terrible.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.160
 New York City, it's like all Manhattan is good.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.640
 And big chunks of the outer boroughs are good.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:37.920
 And like, it's great.

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:42.800
 Did you know there are other places in the world where it's 70 degrees in the evening?

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:43.600
 Did you know that?

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:44.480
 I don't know if you know that.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.560
 Adam, trust me, I do know that.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.640
 That's like, and you don't have to live in New York.

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.960
 As I get older, I'm like, I got to get out of New York.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.440
 Like once the kids are out, I'm like, just New York State.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.840
 Like just the weather wise, I'm just done with the weather.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.400
 You know, like, I just want to be warm all the time.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.440
 Like I am getting that point.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:03.280
 Like I used to like the four seasons of all that stuff, but it's wearing on me.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.080
 I'm like, man.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:08.320
 Hey, if you want to, if you want to be warm all the time, I've got just the spot for you.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.280
 Yeah, I might have to get out.

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:09.840
 That's great.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.200
 Yeah, Dallas.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.520
 I just discovered Miami last year.

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.920
 I'd never been really into like into Miami.

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:19.280
 And wasn't sure what I think about it, but it was awesome.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:19.760
 It was great.

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:20.560
 We had a great time.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:21.680
 It was good stuff.

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:24.720
 I only spent three days there, but I got to get down there again.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:30.320
 You know, someone showed me a trick the other day where if you're familiar with the city

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:34.000
 and you ask Chachi PT, and you're going to New City, you ask it like,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.600
 oh, what's the equivalent neighborhood to like the one you're familiar with?

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.800
 It does like a fantastic job.

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:42.480
 They like like describing the city in terms of neighborhoods you're familiar with.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.440
 And it works perfectly.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.040
 Chachi PT coming through again.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.480
 That's a great trick.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.760
 All right.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.280
 So let's cover Adam.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:54.960
 We should cover a little bit about what you're doing before we go dive into the controversy

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.360
 of the day, but I was playing around with your tool.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:00.000
 I think your main tool is the stat news, right?

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.680
 Is that kind of your main day job?

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:02.880
 Yeah.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.320
 Yeah, these days, that's my day job.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.280
 So I was there.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:06.800
 We started like 10 years ago.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.240
 I was there for like five years and gone for three.

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.600
 And I've been back for a couple.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.000
 Oh, wow.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.320
 So yeah, it's my day job right now.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:19.840
 So just to describe this to people, it's like, well, I was looking at one of the sports stats

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.040
 and but it seems like it does other things as well, potentially.

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:27.440
 But and so I didn't realize it was that old though, because I thought it was like an AI thing.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:31.120
 I'm like, just typing in like, who had the most home runs in baseball before 1945?

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.000
 And it's like Babe Ruth.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.560
 And like, so I just figured it's like, you know, it's a cool little,

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:39.440
 they're doing some AI stuff and turning into queries, but you were you were doing that before.

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.480
 Chachi.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.640
 No, we do it like the very brute force way.

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.120
 I mean, it's not it's not LLM.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:45.760
 Yeah, yeah.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.920
 You just get a slack message and you got to go look up.

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:51.920
 Shoot, Babe Ruth, go look it up.

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.360
 Not AWS.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:53.840
 What was that?

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.760
 AWS mechanical Turk, you know?

00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:00.720
 Wow, that's really cool.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.000
 It does a great job.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.680
 Yeah, no, we that's how we start we started just like is it's just giving you like tables

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.840
 and charts for sports questions.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:13.840
 Now we do have a finance thing sports is much bigger for us.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:16.800
 Like we really hit kind of a nerve in the NBA community.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.200
 Now I think we have we have all of North American sports.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.560
 We just did European soccer.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:26.400
 So I don't know if you know anything about Premier League, but we've got Premier League now.

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.880
 So that's a nice, yeah.

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.880
 I'm more of a I was more of a La Liga guy when messy was there.

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.640
 But now now I just watch messy in the U.S.

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.200
 So I don't have to even worry about the Europeans anymore.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.280
 Police pulling America.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.520
 You know, it's wild.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:45.280
 Okay, so the weird thing about Miami is I don't know.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:50.400
 I can't really explain why this is a case, but celebrity just like randomly end up in like

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.720
 very normal situations right next to you.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.880
 Like these are all the pictures of him at the grocery store.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:55.840
 I did.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:56.960
 Oh, I actually didn't see that.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.560
 And I can't I have to like really stress this.

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:03.200
 This is like the most normal grocery store on the planet.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:07.040
 It's like where you would go with your family and then you turn an aisle message.

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.120
 Just they're like looking at jams.

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:11.360
 Like it's such a weird situation.

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:15.040
 And the picture I posted the other day of Jeff Bezos just walking around my neighborhood.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.240
 Yeah, that was wild.

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.320
 It's really odd.

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:19.200
 Wild.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.680
 That is the cool thing about cities is like you got that.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.040
 You know, there's just people walking in New York.

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:23.840
 It's similar to God.

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:26.960
 There's just people walking around and it's like there they are.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.880
 And then the restaurant with you or whatever.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.240
 I think in New York, it's it's so much easier to be anonymous.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:36.160
 I thought you would just never notice someone that's around because so many people.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.720
 Like I said, I did see a good amount.

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:42.480
 I think the one that jumps to mind is I was at a restaurant

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.960
 and the table right next to me was Michael Sarah the whole time.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.400
 And he did not look good.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.240
 You just didn't he just did not look good.

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:53.520
 Like he looked kind of bummed out and like just not healthy and I don't know.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.120
 It just was a sad vibe.

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.520
 There was this place on West Broadway we used to go.

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.280
 That was like this really awesome restaurant.

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.200
 Just like a little hole in the wall type place.

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.360
 And there was like, what's that?

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.680
 I think it's like Josh Hartnett or something like that.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:06.400
 It's the guy's name.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.240
 There's like 20 years ago or something.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.600
 Anyway, he was just in there like eating.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.160
 I think I saw him in there twice and just like, oh yeah,

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.360
 it's just like his spot.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:16.560
 He just goes there and sits at the bar and eats and like nobody messes with him.

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.040
 Nobody went up to him and was like, give me your autograph or whatever.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.360
 Just like, you know, he's just in a local.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:24.880
 Yeah, we also saw.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:28.880
 Louis CK, like Pete cancellation time too.

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:30.480
 And he also did not look very good.

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:35.440
 It was also an ice cream store.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.080
 So it just looked like he just looked extra depressed because he's just there

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.920
 like getting ice cream.

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:43.840
 And he's like eating ice cream alone, drowning is not a good look.

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:48.480
 The only famous person I've run into in Dallas is Troy Aikman.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:51.920
 He was like sitting at, I was at a restaurant once and he was sitting like one table over.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.480
 And I was like, I think I knew that guy.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.200
 And I didn't.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.080
 It was Troy Aikman.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:01.920
 You ever seen one famous Neosarks Adam?

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.360
 You ever seen Brad Pitt?

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:04.400
 Brad Pitt all this time.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.960
 No, actually his parents still live here.

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.320
 So his brother has like an electronic store or something here.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:10.880
 Oh wow.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.640
 And his brother looks exactly like him.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:13.600
 Like exactly like him.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:14.720
 But not enough for it.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:15.920
 Because he looked enough like him.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.280
 I mean, pretty similar.

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.920
 If he looked enough like him, he wouldn't own an electronic store.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.480
 So it's fair.

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:25.200
 I've never seen famous people.

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.400
 There's no famous people here.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:30.640
 Is that why is that why people live in cities?

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:31.120
 Like that's it.

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:32.000
 It's the celebrities.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.480
 Because I just can't, I can't put it together in my mind.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:37.520
 Like people always say like, oh, you've got everything.

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:38.080
 Everything is here.

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.680
 I think if you have like 100,000 people,

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.520
 you've got accommodations for everything you'd want to do.

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.320
 You have like a zoo and like target.

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:45.120
 I mean, I don't know.

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.240
 I don't know what's on your list.

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:47.200
 He's beyond it.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.680
 Like target is the big zoo.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.240
 Wouldn't have even made my list if I'd be in honest.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.800
 I don't know.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.000
 What do you guys have on the list?

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.200
 I'll say not on the list.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:57.920
 I don't understand.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:03.440
 You're so you're so you're living such a different life

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.600
 that you don't even you don't even understand what you don't have.

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:06.080
 That's how far.

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:06.480
 I will.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:09.440
 I will say saying zoo and bowling alley.

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:13.440
 That does that does betray a little bit of the different life you're living.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.200
 I mean, I'm not using any of that stuff anyway.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.760
 Like I don't leave my house and I wouldn't if I lived in the city.

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.800
 But like I just don't understand like what are the things like Broadway?

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:21.200
 Is that it?

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.800
 It's like you can go to Broadway shows in New York.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.560
 It's like what is the thing you guys have?

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:25.120
 Too far.

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:25.920
 The other direction.

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:26.400
 Yeah.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.120
 So liberty.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:30.720
 Just lives on the internet.

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.080
 That's what I'm the vibe I'm getting, right?

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:33.680
 He's like, you're just sitting all native.

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:34.960
 Yeah, we do.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:35.600
 Yeah.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.560
 Increasingly so.

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.080
 I will say out.

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.120
 How do you get off the internet?

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.280
 This is an interesting question I have for people.

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.520
 Do you do you get off the internet or no?

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.920
 Is there anything explicitly you do to get off the internet?

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:47.360
 Or are you just too locked in right now?

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:48.800
 I'm the last person.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:49.920
 You guys at least have children.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.360
 Yeah.

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.160
 I imagine that.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:52.720
 We're forced.

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.520
 That's kind of important to like pay attention to.

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:56.240
 I imagine.

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:59.840
 I guess I imagine a day where I spend like next to no time on the internet.

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.200
 But I'm not there at now, yeah.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.000
 Yeah.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:02.880
 Adam, you fight.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:05.280
 Don't you do like judo, taekwondo, something like that?

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:05.760
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:06.720
 Jiu-Jitsu.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:07.360
 Yeah, there you go.

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.360
 You named two martial arts without saying Jiu-Jitsu.

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.640
 Yeah, without saying the one.

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.600
 That's pretty good.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:12.800
 I do know you're vegan.

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:13.680
 I got that part.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:14.320
 I'm a vegan.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.640
 I couldn't remember the martial art that you do.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:17.040
 Yeah.

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:17.920
 I did some yesterday.

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:19.200
 My face is a little beat up.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.720
 Like my days after open mat, I'm like all black eyed and everything.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.360
 Here's a interesting tidbit for you, Ian.

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:29.920
 Adam, in his infinite wisdom, was like, I don't need health insurance.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:32.000
 Why would I ever have health insurance?

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.920
 And then he's like, I'm going to get into Jiu-Jitsu.

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:37.920
 And then also separately, for some reason, go to the hospital like four times.

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:38.960
 Yeah, literally.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:40.560
 I dropped my health insurance.

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:43.600
 And I went to the hospital twice and started Jiu-Jitsu.

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.760
 So yeah, not a good recipe.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:48.000
 I've still saved money.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:48.880
 Just to be clear.

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.240
 That's the best part.

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.000
 Still save a lot of stuff.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.760
 No, that's not great.

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:54.880
 This is not a philosophy I subscribe to.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.480
 This is so risky.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:57.440
 That's the most technical truth.

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.840
 This is definitely bad.

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:00.880
 Wait, wait, wait.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:01.840
 You've got to get the health insurance.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.320
 At least just get the one that covers nothing.

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:05.520
 Except for like, you're literally--

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:06.160
 Even this.

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.600
 That's the one I have.

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.200
 That's the one I have, though.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.320
 It's not about the money for me.

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.520
 I've done it for 15 years.

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:12.400
 It's the principal.

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.160
 I just don't want to buy into the system.

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.160
 The system's just so bad and so dumb

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.600
 that I just don't want to be a part of it.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.320
 Like, what if you lose your house and all your stuff?

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:24.000
 Because, like, you can afford it when you get hit by a bus.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:24.560
 Like, that's not--

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:27.040
 Don't they say you don't have to pay medical bills or something?

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:27.360
 I don't know.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.240
 You don't even have to pay on it.

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:29.280
 I don't know.

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:30.800
 I think you're seeking an opposite.

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:33.360
 I think you're the only ones you can't discharge.

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:33.840
 Yeah.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:34.720
 Yeah.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:35.680
 I don't know.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:36.160
 Yeah.

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.120
 A lot of risks there.

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:40.880
 Wait, my friends' honor or something

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.440
 worked at a hospital billing thing, whatever?

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.680
 And I don't know if this is true.

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:47.200
 It definitely sounds extremely made up.

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.680
 But he is like, the way they work,

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:53.200
 if you literally just send them $1 every time they ask you to pay,

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.960
 they'll, like, some, like, counter-resets.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:57.440
 And then he's just going on for years,

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:58.960
 and they eventually just give up.

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.800
 That's incredible.

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:04.000
 You know what we do with every medical bill we get?

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.560
 Literally everyone that's over $100.

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.760
 We call and say, what if I give you less?

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:10.640
 Yeah, exactly.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:11.120
 Right now.

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.720
 I was just going to say that.

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.680
 On the phone right now, I'll give you 70%.

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:17.040
 And you can run my credit card.

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.360
 And they're always like, yeah, okay, that's fine.

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:20.080
 Yeah.

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:20.960
 It's great.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:21.440
 It's great.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:24.880
 You just ignore the fashion letter.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.280
 You get the second letter, and then you call,

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.720
 and you're like, oh, wow, shoot.

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:29.520
 Oh, geez.

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:29.920
 Goodness.

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.040
 What if I give you 70%?

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.000
 And they're like, oh, that's awesome.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.040
 Let's do it.

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:33.280
 Yeah.

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:34.080
 It's great.

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:34.880
 That definitely works.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.120
 Everybody should do that for sure.

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.160
 Like, because that's just the--

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.920
 Even if you're like, we have the high deductible,

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.440
 because yeah, I don't want to pay, whatever.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.360
 I have the money to pay for like, a couple thousand dollars

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:43.760
 here and there.

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:45.440
 But I don't want to have to pay a million dollars

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.120
 if I get sick or whatever.

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:50.240
 So yeah, when we get bills like that,

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.160
 you just call them and be like, I'm not paying this.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.440
 I'm paying out of pocket for this.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.040
 Like, what are you going to do for me?

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.280
 And then it's always at least like 25% off or more.

00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:59.280
 And that's just with like the bare minimum fighting bag.

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:00.160
 Just calling.

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:02.240
 I'm sure you get 50% off if you like,

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.360
 really stuck to your guns.

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:04.400
 Mm-hmm.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.160
 I've had any greater situation than that.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.840
 So let's have to get her a call letter out.

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:12.480
 And they quoted us like over $100,000 or something.

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.360
 Oh, wow.

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.120
 And we were just like, uh-uh.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:19.680
 And then I went, we went and looked up like all this stuff

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:23.200
 and it ended up being pushed down to like around $10,000.

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:23.920
 Oh, wow.

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.600
 And they technically keep trying to ask us for more

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:29.200
 and we just haven't responded in like years and nothing happened.

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:30.000
 So.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.280
 Isn't there something and like I did not do all this research

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:34.400
 because I was dropping help insurance?

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.160
 But isn't there something where like,

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.600
 they can't hit your credit or something with medical bills?

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.200
 Are there something like, if you don't pay,

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.800
 it's a different system or something?

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:43.600
 Could be.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.200
 Yeah, it could be something like that.

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.040
 Hey, you just sent the collections and the collections

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:48.640
 tries to bother you and they eventually give up.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:49.840
 That's been my experience.

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.120
 I can see that.

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:51.840
 Yeah.

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:52.640
 Mm-hmm.

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:53.920
 Are you working over this?

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.680
 You know, this is financial advice.

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:58.160
 No, nobody listened to this, please.

00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:58.960
 Oh, boy.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:24:59.440
 Yeah.

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:00.160
 This is rough one.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.040
 Yeah.

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:03.040
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:04.320
 I've always had the health insurance.

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.440
 I like the health insurance.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.120
 I like the health insurance.

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:10.480
 Sort of a write-off.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:12.560
 You know, yeah, we're on the same page.

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:13.520
 There you go.

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:16.080
 We have our little disagreements here and there,

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:18.400
 but I like the health insurance.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.600
 There you go.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:20.240
 There you go.

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:20.640
 Yeah.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.880
 I like the health insurance.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:23.440
 Oh, man.

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.200
 All right, all right.

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.480
 Let's get into some meat here.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:28.240
 We bought on the mostly a lot.

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.600
 Let's jump over to the technical.

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.120
 Yeah.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.520
 So you guys are perfect for this because I feel like you guys

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.680
 are on the JavaScripty end of the world.

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.040
 We're on the layer of the end of the world.

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:40.960
 I mean, I know nothing about JavaScript.

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.720
 I know next year's all this stuff.

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:45.840
 I spent a couple months last year learning React

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.840
 just so I have some idea what's going on.

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.040
 It was like maybe I was going to use it

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.000
 for some projects or whatever.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.560
 I have a little idea of like pure React,

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.000
 but none of the like full stack

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.520
 how it runs on the server and that stuff.

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:59.040
 And obviously this week we've been coming out with

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.760
 you guys are talking to Taylor tomorrow

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.840
 is my understanding, right?

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:06.880
 On your podcast, so if I check that out, we'll link that up.

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:10.640
 But yeah, so Taylor had his little post,

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.320
 which I thought was from the layer of perspective,

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.720
 made a lot of sense about how full stack

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:17.760
 layerable is and how it lets you build real applications

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:18.960
 quickly and reliably.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:24.080
 And it's kind of like batteries included has everything you need.

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.960
 And versus kind of the JavaScript meaning of full stack,

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.600
 which at least in my understanding and my limited experience

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:33.120
 is more kind of like all the parts are sort of out there

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:36.320
 to do it, but you really have to put it all together yourself

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:39.840
 and there's not a unifying opinionated,

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:47.040
 overarching sort of framework or just even standards around that.

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.520
 So that's my summary.

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:53.120
 I don't know if you guys have anything to add to that summary of the situation.

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:55.520
 No, I think that makes sense.

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:59.760
 Yeah, it's funny because in this situation,

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:03.120
 yeah, me and Adam represent the JavaScript side, but I think

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:06.880
 the interesting detail here is we're both.

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:10.080
 I mean, me and Adam are both full stack people,

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.240
 but that term is obviously very, very loose.

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:16.400
 Both of us go very deep on the back inside,

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.480
 like deeper than what most people would say full stack

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.080
 is because we do a lot of infrastructure work.

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:25.520
 The question to ask is why are either of us even doing

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:26.640
 JavaScript in the first place?

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.080
 It's not like this is the only thing we've ever done.

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.920
 I'm actually somewhat newer to it.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:32.480
 I only started doing JavaScript in the back end in the last three years.

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:35.840
 I had a bunch of different stacks before then.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.840
 I think Adam's the same as well.

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:41.200
 The question is like, why are we even here?

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.480
 Neither of us like the language.

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:45.040
 We're not here because we're like, we love JavaScript.

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:48.880
 No backend and JavaScript engineers really like that.

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:52.160
 SST also primarily serve, even though we talk about front-end stuff a lot,

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:56.960
 our audience is primarily backend JavaScript engineers.

00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:00.720
 So the only reason any of us are doing JavaScript

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.280
 is because at some point a lot of us

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:09.200
 bought into the idea of picking a cloud and utilizing it maximally.

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:13.280
 So prior to this, I was building things in Elixir,

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:15.040
 prior to that in Go, prior to that in C#.

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:21.840
 Those systems are more around creating a nice little bubble for you to live in,

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:23.360
 and then you can deploy that bubble anywhere,

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:26.000
 whether it's AWS on your own servers, whatever.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.560
 There's little adapters for things, so you can kind of use

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:31.040
 some of the features that are in each of these providers.

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:36.160
 But at some point, a bunch of us had the notion of,

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:38.880
 if you really commit yourself to a certain cloud,

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.520
 they can really handle a lot of things for you

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:44.480
 way more than you can with a more agnostic framework.

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.960
 And it just gives us a fundamental tradeoff.

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.160
 And it's fine if that doesn't click for you,

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.600
 but it has clicked for a bunch of people.

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:55.520
 Unfortunately, the best language to program these things

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:56.320
 is JavaScript.

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:58.000
 That's what these clouds were built around.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.400
 And if you look at some of the more newer ones like CloudFlare,

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.920
 I know Ian's a big CloudFlare fan.

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:05.760
 They're even way more oriented around JavaScript.

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:11.280
 So we only bother using JavaScript

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:14.320
 because it gives us access to all these other things.

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:18.000
 If you went and built us equivalent to

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.280
 Laravel or Lixar Phoenix or Rails,

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.600
 we just wouldn't bother using JavaScript.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:26.320
 Do we just go back to one of these other systems

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:30.080
 that are more mature with languages that we prefer?

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:31.120
 That's at least my take.

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:33.520
 It's the only reason why I'm in JavaScript land.

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:37.120
 I don't have any love for the language or anything.

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.640
 It just gives me access to these things

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.720
 that other ecosystems just do.

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:41.680
 They just don't build that way.

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:48.080
 Well, a lot of those Cloud elements are accessible

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:50.560
 from even a backend-oriented framework.

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:53.520
 I mean, it kind of removes the requirement,

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:54.320
 I guess, for some of the

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:59.360
 they've kind of glued it together with JavaScript,

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:02.400
 where it's more accessible from JavaScript.

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:06.720
 But all the AWS stuff you can use from a Laravel app too,

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:07.920
 or the vast majority of it, right?

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:09.760
 There are these things like CloudFlare workers,

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.120
 which super annoyingly, like, yeah,

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.880
 you have to write JavaScript or whatever.

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:17.200
 But all the whatever, S3 or RDS or whatever,

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:20.640
 all the big stuff is accessible from anything, really.

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:22.880
 So I don't know.

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:23.680
 Yeah, it's like--

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:27.280
 I feel like when the stuff that DAX is talking about

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:30.880
 is less like the RDS and more like the step functions

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:32.800
 and stuff like that, where it helps you work straight up.

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:34.080
 Right, way out the backend.

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.600
 Yeah, it helps you orchestrate

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.520
 what you would maybe traditionally do

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:40.800
 in a monolithic backend in Laravel or Rails.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:43.920
 And instead, you break it up into these AWS

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:47.520
 or otherwise primitives that then kind of form up

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:51.840
 your backend out of these little pieces instead of a monolith.

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:52.560
 Yeah.

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:55.360
 Yeah, and it's funny you bring up stuff functions

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:57.040
 because I hate stuff functions.

00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:00.800
 And I would say on this spectrum of like going really hard

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.400
 with like doing AWS native stuff,

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:03.920
 I actually don't go that far.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:04.880
 There's just a spectrum, right?

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.440
 Like I think that Ian mentioned,

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.760
 like you can deploy a Laravel app

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:13.200
 that are using the adapters that are for AWS flavor of things,

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.600
 like for events, for queues, for all those things.

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:18.880
 Then there's like a step further where you're like,

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.920
 I don't like imagine that you didn't care about

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:24.480
 letting me move this Laravel app to a different cloud.

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:27.440
 You would use it a little bit more intensely and use more of it

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.840
 and have, give you like functionality,

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:31.760
 like spin that stuff up and down really easily.

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:33.600
 And that's kind of the zone that I operate in.

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.680
 It's kind of the zone that Adam operates in as well.

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:41.280
 And I would say the majority of like modern backend JavaScript

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:45.120
 that's like starting up today, it fits in in that category.

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:47.840
 If you're not doing that, I don't really know

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:53.120
 why you'd be running JavaScript as your backend thing.

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:55.200
 Like it just, I haven't really seen it.

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:58.720
 And like, I don't know, it just doesn't make sense to me.

00:31:58.720 --> 00:31:59.440
 What's your theory?

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:00.800
 I have this theory.

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:01.680
 All right.

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:02.640
 And I don't know anything.

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:03.200
 Yeah.

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.760
 This is totally the box.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:07.200
 There's no box here at all.

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:08.320
 We don't need them.

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:08.960
 We don't need them.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:15.120
 But like how much is like JavaScript kind of taking over the

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:19.280
 mindset of a lot of programming and things like that is,

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:21.520
 I guess I feel like a lot of it from the outside world

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:27.680
 feels very VC money backed and how are there really a lot of

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:33.280
 applications in production in the tens,

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:35.360
 hundreds of millions of dollars, billions of dollars

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.840
 that are running like this.

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:39.280
 Do you know what I'm saying?

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:42.560
 Like just deploying for the JavaScript front end

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:46.400
 and the connectors and it's actually running a billion

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:47.040
 dollar business.

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:51.040
 Like not just a billion dollar business of like on paper,

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:54.160
 but a real like revenue generating billion

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:54.880
 dollar business.

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:57.040
 Like I don't know if it's just too early and they're not there

00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:58.960
 or maybe they're out there and I'm not as aware of them.

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:03.680
 Obviously like a lot of big enterprise stuff is not built

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:04.160
 this way.

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:07.280
 So it's more newer web-y stuff.

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:08.080
 But I don't know.

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.560
 I'm curious what you guys are aware about there.

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:11.440
 That's like that.

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:16.000
 Yeah, what's funny is there's actually a lot of enterprise usage

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.920
 of this for the same reason I just mentioned.

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:20.560
 What do enterprises use?

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:21.600
 They use AWS.

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:23.520
 What do they try to do a lot of?

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:25.680
 Like they try to offload a lot of their work to AWS,

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:26.880
 especially if they're not a tech company.

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:31.280
 So weirdly some of the earliest adoption of that stuff

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.640
 is in big enterprise.

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:35.440
 Like I don't probably know this better,

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:39.360
 but like a lot of the AWS heroes and people from that world,

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:41.120
 they all work at these big enterprise companies,

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:41.600
 right?

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:42.880
 Is that a question to me?

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:46.560
 You're at a different point.

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:48.960
 We should've gone over that at the beginning.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.320
 I thought it was rhetorical.

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:52.640
 I didn't know you were actually asking me this question.

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:57.040
 Yeah, I mean a lot of the heroes do work at like random big companies.

00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:59.040
 I know that because I don't know about these companies.

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:01.120
 It's like not big names that I've heard of,

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:03.040
 just like random companies.

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:08.880
 So like they built out a new system in this more modern style.

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:10.800
 It's not necessarily running their whole enterprise.

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:14.240
 Right? Because like they have a cobalt app somewhere doing something like whatever.

00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:17.920
 But it's like we have a new internal app that's doing whatever,

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:19.760
 something for the HR department or whatever they're doing.

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:23.120
 And they're going to build it on this stack as like a freestanding.

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:27.120
 Yeah, one of the big examples, like when people talk about serverless,

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:30.160
 like adoption in the enterprise, it's Lego.

00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:34.080
 So Lego had this big transformation where they went from kind of traditional

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:37.840
 app architecture to just very modern, like event driven stuff.

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:42.880
 I honestly, I know there's like whole pages on AWS site,

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:46.080
 about like companies that have adopted these modern approaches.

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:46.800
 I don't remember.

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:50.880
 Yeah, so there's a lot.

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:54.960
 And I think we've experienced this because our SST took a very weird route.

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:59.600
 Usually a framework starts low end of the market and then moves to higher end.

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:04.320
 Weirdly, we got adoption first in the higher end because these companies were,

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:05.360
 this is how they were building stuff.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.680
 So they're more familiar with our approach.

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:10.400
 And even though our tools were rough, like they had expertise in it.

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.720
 So they could, they were the early adopters.

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:14.800
 We've been working to like bring it down market to like,

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:19.200
 you know, the people that are building smaller things.

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:22.960
 But those are examples of enterprise side on like,

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:26.560
 like the more like startupy type thing.

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:30.720
 I hate bringing this up because I like obsessively bring up linear.

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:32.560
 And I'm like, so self-conscious every time I bring it up.

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:35.600
 Because I think they're just the best app ever built.

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.680
 And their backend is in JavaScript.

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:40.960
 It's, but the point here though, is that like,

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:43.760
 my point is like, it's kind of irrelevant.

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:44.720
 That's in JavaScript.

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:46.560
 Like they're just a really talented team.

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:49.520
 And like, they would have just made it great.

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:51.680
 And it's not like, oh, they use JavaScript.

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:52.800
 Therefore they were successful.

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:56.640
 You know, it's just like, that's kind of like an irrelevant detail.

00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:02.080
 But there are quite a lot of examples in the past, like I would say five or so years.

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:06.720
 So this whole conversation, I want to make sure Ian, when you talk about like,

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:12.880
 the VC and the noise, like, it's most of the noise on Twitter.

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:15.760
 And if so, I don't even know how much of it's even back in JavaScript.

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:18.720
 How much of it's just front end, right?

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:19.920
 There's a lot of more exposure.

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:21.280
 I think the front end JavaScript, right?

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:25.760
 Like everybody works at Purcell and who knows what they're all doing there, right?

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:29.200
 Like nobody knows like, and that kind of thing.

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:36.880
 Yeah, I do think we can't ignore the fact like, you know, they've spent 300 million or so.

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:38.160
 I think they've raised another 250.

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:41.520
 Like you spend that kind of money in a space.

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.040
 Like it's going to have some amount of impact.

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:45.600
 So you can't say it like no one can say, oh, it's zero.

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:47.120
 I was like all natural.

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:53.520
 And I do think a lot of the noise specifically comes from them, especially with several is.

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:55.360
 Sorry.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:37:02.480
 They've raised $550 million, like that buys some Twitter audience or Twitter banter.

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:03.680
 You just impact in the world.

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:08.160
 Like if you spend that much capital on anything, you're going to be able to build something around

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.200
 unless you're completely stupid.

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:15.360
 Well, the linear thing's kind of interesting to me because it sort of represents a little bit

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:17.760
 what we're kind of talking about to somebody because like they had an issue.

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:21.600
 Like I'm a, I experimented with using linear.

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:22.640
 We didn't fully move over to it.

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:25.440
 But I was on there, whatever, I get their emails and whatnot.

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:29.600
 And it's like they had some kind of data issue where they lost like 12 hours of data.

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:31.680
 And like for 24 or 12 or 24.

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:36.800
 And I know it was weird to me, like they didn't have a point in time database recovery

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:41.200
 and like maybe five minutes of data but to lose 24 hours of data, there's a lot of data.

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:45.920
 And like, so to me, it's like one of these like they're not a back end thinking company, right?

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:48.480
 So it's like, yeah, we just shoved the data up there.

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:51.600
 Who knows what those default settings were if it was configured correctly or whatever.

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.440
 I mean, now maybe they just lost it through some other means.

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:56.640
 I don't know, but I don't need the details there.

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.720
 But it was, they think that place was kind of weird.

00:37:58.720 --> 00:37:59.920
 I think they did recover it.

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:04.400
 But that situation was actually not from like their database messing up.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:10.160
 So the reason why linear is so impressive compared to other apps is because they sync

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:14.240
 all the data to the front end and it's like a crazy complex.

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:17.600
 It's basically like treating every browser as like another replica in your database.

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:23.920
 So that is like really sophisticated distribution problems and they had some kind of weird issue

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:24.320
 with that.

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:29.040
 So I think there were some rights that just stuck locally and like didn't make it up or something

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:35.200
 or there was like massively delayed and obviously remurging after 12 hours causes a bunch of conflicts.

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:40.160
 Yeah, so I think that was that situation.

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:44.560
 But I do agree with your point that I think the root of all this is

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.680
 again, to me, it just feels so made up.

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:51.360
 It's like there's a lot of people that start with something like Next.js and they're like,

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:52.400
 this is my whole application.

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:53.680
 It's just a Next.js application.

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:57.680
 And I think the impression externally is like that's what the jobs community is.

00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:59.200
 But literally nobody does this.

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:01.600
 No, like serious company does this.

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:08.480
 The reason we focus a lot on helping companies deploy Next.js is because 90% of their system

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:10.080
 is this like AWS thing.

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:12.240
 Sometimes in JavaScript, sometimes not.

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:16.800
 They're using Next.js in the front end and it's a pain in the ass to deploy alongside the rest of

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:17.280
 their stuff.

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:19.200
 So they come to us and we help them figure that out.

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.200
 This is not their whole app.

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.520
 Like they do not care about Next.js.

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:27.440
 They're not like, oh, like we have to like have all the latest features and needs to be deployed

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:27.600
 number.

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:29.200
 So they just don't care.

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:31.280
 It's just the react default, right?

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:35.040
 Like it's replaced create react app is like the default way to create a react app.

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:36.800
 Yeah.

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:40.000
 And there are people like trying to use it for like everything.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.720
 Like my whole system isn't actually, but you can't even, it has no solution for doing any asynchronous

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:45.360
 work.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:48.560
 Like just, that's just a non-starter for like anything.

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:49.840
 The real app is coming.

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:51.760
 Ship week's coming, Dax.

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:53.680
 They couldn't have it this year.

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:55.760
 That's true.

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:56.720
 That is true.

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:58.080
 What is their ship week?

00:39:58.080 --> 00:39:59.760
 I think it's the same.

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:00.000
 I think.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.520
 No, Dax is going to go crazy on ship week.

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:06.480
 But here's the thing though.

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:09.680
 I am going on vacation to Europe.

00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:11.600
 I'm sorry, Liz.

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:12.400
 I'm sorry, Liz.

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:15.600
 They should have something got to be saved.

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:16.880
 You know, she literally told me.

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:19.120
 She was like, no, funny with herself on vacation.

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:23.120
 Well, I don't know if she knows you very well.

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.640
 I know y'all are married or whatever.

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:27.680
 But I can't resist.

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:29.440
 How long are you going for?

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:30.400
 How long are you going for?

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:32.480
 I'm going to Lisbon and Spain for a week.

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:36.320
 And I'll be here for their ship week announcement, which I am curious about.

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:38.560
 But maybe he could hold out a week.

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:40.080
 I mean, I could see him.

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:42.320
 There's no way he can hold out a week.

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:43.520
 It's not like four weeks.

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:44.800
 It's like one week.

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:47.760
 Listen, Adam's not going to understand this reference.

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:49.680
 But this is red meat for Dax.

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:51.440
 Ship week is red meat.

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:53.840
 Like he's got a pounce on it.

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:56.080
 No, no, no, no.

00:40:56.080 --> 00:41:02.160
 My whole attitude to this is I have, you know, like you like sort of fire,

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:04.240
 like, you know, I've like gotten the smoke going.

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:07.440
 And I think other people will, I can delegate this one.

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:08.320
 I'm hoping.

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:09.200
 Delegate.

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:13.040
 To the people.

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:14.000
 Incredible.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:14.960
 The disciples.

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:14.960
 Okay.

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:17.920
 So what did you think, Dax and Adam?

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:24.160
 What did you think about the discourse on Twitter around the Laravelle JavaScript?

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:24.960
 What's a framework?

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:25.760
 What's back in?

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:27.040
 Michael Jackson.

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:27.680
 Isn't that his name?

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:29.040
 That's definitely his name.

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.400
 Michael Jackson remixed.

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.080
 The most un-goole thing in the world.

00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:34.160
 Yeah.

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:36.320
 Michael Jackson react router version seven.

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:42.160
 So he weighed in Ryan Florence weighed in, Taylor weighed in, everybody weighed in.

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:44.800
 Y'all are having them on the show tomorrow.

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:48.320
 So what are your thoughts as you're prepping for this big show?

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:50.080
 What were your thoughts watching all of us go down?

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:50.560
 Prepping.

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:54.720
 They're prepping right now.

00:41:54.720 --> 00:42:01.520
 Dax is allergic to anything prepping or process or

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:03.120
 perfect writing things down.

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:03.600
 I don't right.

00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:04.960
 I think Adam had some feelings.

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:05.760
 I saw him post.

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:12.240
 I mean, I just feel like so when people say like the JavaScript world,

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:16.720
 we don't have this kind of like full full stack, full list stack,

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:17.440
 fuller stack.

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:18.080
 I don't know.

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:20.400
 We don't have that, but we do like there are a few of them.

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:21.520
 People have tried.

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:23.040
 They just weren't the most popular.

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:26.960
 Like they didn't take over in the way that maybe like are there

00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:30.720
 is there an equivalent in PHP world where there's like little like do it yourself.

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:32.240
 Grab your own pieces frameworks.

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:33.120
 Like what?

00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:34.640
 Some people tried that.

00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:36.160
 Yeah, they became very popular.

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:40.560
 No, but some people have tried like, yeah, we give you ultimate freedom

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:43.520
 to pick your favorite packages and tie them together loosely.

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:45.840
 And everybody's like, it seems hard.

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:49.440
 So my view is just that it's like random that like in the JavaScript world,

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:52.000
 for whatever reason, the ones that went out and became popular

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.320
 were these kind of like modular systems and the ones in PHP and Rails.

00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:59.600
 I think what Dax said, I mean, all that stuff about infrastructure

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:02.400
 and cloud in the last few years, that makes sense.

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:06.800
 I get it. I guess I just, I feel like it's all kind of like straying them.

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:09.120
 Yeah, I definitely agree with that.

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:14.720
 I think there's like it's people really understate how much things come down

00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:19.840
 to a specific time, a specific person, things lining up in a certain way.

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:24.960
 So Jay, CEO, he described this thing.

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:31.440
 I forgot what coach it was, but he was talking about his team over the years.

00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:36.560
 And it's the same group of people on the team, but it's like a different team every year.

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:39.840
 It's like, this is the 2022 team, this is a 2023 team.

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:43.760
 Even though it looks the same, it's like, you treat it like a different era.

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:47.200
 So I think there is a lot of that going on with things that are like

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:53.200
 as incredible as some of this stuff, like to have to get this big, to have this level of influence.

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:56.160
 There's so much variability and randomness and stuff.

00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:59.280
 There's so many things, right?

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:02.240
 Like JavaScript, I would say had a big reset with TypeScript.

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:06.160
 Like it came out, it got to a point where it sort of became the default,

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:09.920
 but then it took even longer than that for people to like understand it well enough

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:11.840
 to actually build the right level of tooling.

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:13.600
 And that's kind of what's happening now.

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:16.800
 You start to see libraries come out that are like correctly using it.

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:20.720
 And also, it's like we're at TypeScript v5 now.

00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:23.280
 I wouldn't even say all this was possible to like around v4.

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:26.560
 So there's just been a lot of change and variation.

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:32.160
 I'm convinced though that there's been a bunch of attempts trying to

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:35.360
 do the let's have a Rails for JavaScript thing.

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:38.720
 And there's been like one or two projects that are in that category.

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:41.440
 It just doesn't work.

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:46.160
 Like I said, if you pitch me that and I look at it, I just want to go use a different language.

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:48.960
 That's kind of where I immediately go to.

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:54.640
 In terms of the discourse, it's funny because I think when you're building a framework,

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:59.440
 you're in this category of in a very small pool of people, right?

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:02.800
 Like there's like very few people that I really build and do an open source thing.

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:11.680
 And you ultimately, it's this weird thing where you like are so nerdy about this stuff.

00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:14.720
 So you're like really into other things, even though it's not for you.

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:22.080
 Like I'm sure like Taylor is like super interested in what like remakes index is doing just from

00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:26.400
 like an academic point of view, because it helps him reorient himself and vice versa.

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:27.760
 So like everyone's like studying each other.

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:31.120
 And there's a lot of like just fundamental respect in that way,

00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:35.120
 even though your approaches might be completely opposite at the end of the day.

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:38.720
 So that's kind of what I saw in the initial discourse.

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:40.720
 Like when I saw that, I was like, okay, that's what it is.

00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:42.640
 I study Laravel a lot for our work.

00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:46.800
 Like we look at everything from the way they do their docs to what concepts,

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:48.080
 to how big their scope is.

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:50.960
 And I'm sure everyone is doing that.

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:53.440
 So I found that initial post interesting from that perspective.

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:59.280
 I think as usual on Twitter, it was like, there's an initial interaction that is fine.

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:02.800
 And then like it devolves into a really stupid place after,

00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:05.600
 which is I think it's just how everything goes.

00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:11.440
 I thought there's almost no value in like the general discourse after.

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:14.960
 Going too far down the thread, that makes no point.

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:16.400
 No, yeah, you don't want to go there.

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:21.760
 A couple, I do think the history is super interesting and definitely something people forget.

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:25.920
 Because I do feel like PPP in general, of course, is definitely my background is like,

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:32.800
 and even with Taylor, it's like rooted in a lot of like solo founder with no money at all.

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:36.960
 And so it's like, you know, Taylor worked at UserScape, my company,

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:41.600
 and then when in early Laravel days, and then he built Forge by himself,

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:43.040
 and you know, went off and did that.

00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:46.160
 And it's like, what are the tools that are going to let one person

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:50.080
 with no money go and build a product that makes millions of dollars?

00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:51.440
 And so that's like the mindset.

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:54.160
 Like you don't want to connect a thousand things and have all this complexity.

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:55.840
 You just want to be like, I use this one tool.

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:56.880
 It does everything I need.

00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:01.200
 And now I move forward, whereas like the modern sort of JavaScript ecosystem

00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:03.520
 seems like it's come from a different place, right?

00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:06.640
 Like there is money and there's enterprises and there's VC money.

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:10.160
 And it's like, okay, like we can have specialists even in different roles

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:10.960
 and all that kind of stuff.

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:14.480
 It's not so focused on what one person can achieve with it.

00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:17.360
 As like it's legacy, obviously now.

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:21.680
 I think on both stacks, like one person can do a lot or huge teams can do a lot

00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:24.080
 because they've evolved to that.

00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:30.320
 But the kind of core sort of baked in really deep mindset

00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:33.360
 is maybe a little bit different there about what they're trying to achieve

00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:37.760
 and like how they're trying to achieve that from like a business perspective.

00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:39.920
 And JavaScript is just messier.

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:42.880
 Like they're just like as a messier history, more accidental history.

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:48.960
 The hottest take I have with this is I don't think good engineers

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:52.240
 enter the JavaScript space until the last like three or four years.

00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:56.160
 And I think previously it was stewarded by people that were just a lot less competent.

00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:57.680
 That is a hot take.

00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:04.480
 And I think it's because of what I described like prior to

00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:09.200
 like, why would anyone good on the back end get into jobs from the back end?

00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:11.680
 Like I'm sure there were of course there were individual examples,

00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:14.480
 but broadly, there was like almost no reason to.

00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:20.560
 I think more recently it's attracted a much better caliber of like,

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:24.960
 you know, people that could serve as leaders and things are getting better.

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:28.000
 But there is just a crazy messy history with it.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:33.280
 So yeah, like I said, I don't I wouldn't like choose it if it wasn't for a bunch of other reasons.

00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:36.240
 Well, that's like always the interesting thing about all these languages.

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:39.600
 Like the winner, like the back end, the biggest language is still PHP.

00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:43.200
 Like just in terms of raw number of like lines of code out there and like

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:44.000
 JavaScript on the front end.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.280
 It's like these languages that everybody's like, oh, they're all they're terrible

00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:48.000
 in all different ways.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:48.720
 They're terrible, right?

00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:51.680
 Like everybody beats on PHP and JavaScript forever.

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:55.440
 But these are the biggest languages because they, you know, for whatever reason,

00:48:55.440 --> 00:49:00.160
 some of that ugliness is useful in different ways or it allows more people to access it or

00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:05.680
 whatever the reason they've actually, you know, kind of survived and thrived.

00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:09.600
 Even though there are other languages that are technically superior.

00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:13.360
 Can we hear Aaron Aaron's working on the video, right?

00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:14.640
 Can we get a sneak peek of this video?

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:16.000
 I am working on a video.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:16.960
 Yeah.

00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:22.240
 So I did a I did a did a quick response video that I already published that I was just so

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:22.960
 freaking proud of.

00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:24.720
 I was just so pumped that I turned it around.

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:25.920
 I can believe how fast I was.

00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:27.440
 I was like, what the hell is it the same day?

00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:28.880
 Same day.

00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:34.720
 I called Steve in the morning and I was like, oh, dude, this is this is going to be something.

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:37.840
 We have to do a video and he was like, great, do it.

00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:40.640
 And so I recorded it and sent it over to him and he edited it.

00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:42.080
 And we got it up the same day.

00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:44.080
 Super proud of that.

00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:47.920
 So now I'm working on a, I'm working on a new video.

00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:51.440
 Hopefully it'll be out, you know, today or tomorrow to capitalize.

00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:54.960
 Um, and it's going to be, there's a little sneak peek for everybody.

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:56.880
 It's going to be called Laravel versus react.

00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:00.320
 And then, yeah, it's going to be great already.

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:02.400
 You know, you know, the name is great.

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:05.120
 Yeah, we're good. We're good. We're done.

00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:08.000
 And then it's, uh, it's kind of a, it's kind of a bait and switch.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.640
 And it's, uh, you, Laravel versus react is a ridiculous question.

00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:14.960
 You should use them both together if you want.

00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:16.560
 React is very good on the front end.

00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:18.400
 Laravel is very good on the back end.

00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:24.400
 So it's going to be kind of an overview of like how you can use Laravel with react or

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:27.360
 view or even next JS or live wire.

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:30.720
 And it's a whole like, I'm going to have, you know, charts and graphs drawn by Steve

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:35.280
 that show like where Laravel starts and stops and where react starts and stops

00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:37.440
 in terms of like front end, back end network.

00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:43.440
 Um, and hopefully like my goal, and I think this is Laravel's goal as well,

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:46.800
 is not to convince people not to re to use react.

00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:50.480
 It's to convince people that like there are back end solutions that are really

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:52.880
 thought through and powerful.

00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:55.920
 And you should pair that with your favorite front end solution.

00:50:55.920 --> 00:51:00.160
 I think the thing that I always see is like the, I think DAX mentioned it where

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:03.520
 people like claim next JS is going to be their whole stack.

00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:07.600
 And then it's like everyone else is like, y'all, how does that can't work at all?

00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:12.320
 So hopefully, hopefully the video will convince some people that like next is great.

00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:13.360
 React is great.

00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:14.160
 View is great.

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:17.760
 You should pair it with something on the back end that is powerful.

00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:19.040
 That that is the hope.

00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:21.280
 So we'll see, we'll see if we can pull it off.

00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:23.280
 Nice.

00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:23.920
 I'm excited.

00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:24.960
 Yeah.

00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:29.200
 And again, like just from the systems that we see that just is how even people

00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:33.920
 doing full stack JavaScript, they build a separate system for their back end.

00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:38.560
 That is a lot more capable than what this front end framework can do.

00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:41.840
 So yeah, it's just a weird thing.

00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:45.920
 Like I don't, it's a lot of, it feels like it's everywhere.

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:47.920
 But at the same time, I go look at like our user base.

00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:49.920
 Like it's like nobody's actually doing that.

00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:52.000
 So yeah, it's like,

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.200
 once again, that discourse and the reality are quite different.

00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:56.400
 Yeah.

00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:57.120
 You can believe that.

00:51:58.080 --> 00:51:59.840
 All right, I want to cover two other things.

00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:06.080
 We got, we've got Adams working on a course and we've got the boys started a coffee company.

00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:07.680
 So we got it.

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:08.480
 We got to cover that.

00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:10.640
 Also, we got to give a try to buy this coffee.

00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:12.320
 Just how you buy is totally insane.

00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:12.720
 I love it.

00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:13.920
 Totally insane.

00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:18.080
 We got to give a plug for their podcast tomorrow FM or how about tomorrow.

00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:20.720
 I'll just give a quick rundown.

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:23.840
 The podcast is basically Adams says something like,

00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:29.520
 "Man, Dax, have you ever, have you ever really thought that we're all just going to die one day?"

00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:32.320
 And Dax will say something like,

00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:35.600
 "You know, I've actually thought about this a lot and I actually used to work.

00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:36.960
 I used to work with a guy.

00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:39.520
 And so here's the reality of the situation.

00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:44.800
 So if you, if you like, if you like that vibe, that is their podcast.

00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:47.760
 I like to think of our podcast.

00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:48.880
 This is mostly technical.

00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:50.880
 I like to think ours is like barely technical.

00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:54.480
 But sometimes we say some things that are technical.

00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:59.040
 And if you're not, if you're not very online, you'll get like 40% of it.

00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:02.880
 Actually, Adam, Adam plays the foil a lot.

00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:04.480
 He's like, "Hey Dax, I saw you tweeted this.

00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:05.840
 What, what do you mean?

00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:06.560
 Like, what does this mean?

00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:07.440
 What are you talking about?"

00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:10.240
 And so it kind of brings the audience along.

00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:13.040
 Then once a month, I'll do an hour rant on Bursale and then...

00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:14.400
 Yes, exactly.

00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:15.600
 There we go.

00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:16.400
 The buy you off?

00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:16.880
 Coffee.

00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:19.040
 Let's start coffee, man.

00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:20.240
 Do we want to go there?

00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:21.760
 Yeah, how did this all come out?

00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:22.720
 This is fascinating.

00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:24.160
 I love anything real world.

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:25.760
 It's like physical world.

00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:29.120
 Can we get a box and shove some coffee and ship it out?

00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:30.480
 Like that's so great.

00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:31.040
 Is it?

00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:32.640
 It's all some logistics fun?

00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:34.960
 It's fun, but it's also not fun.

00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:37.520
 It's way better than the reality, I'm sure.

00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:38.000
 Yeah.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:39.600
 The dream of it is amazing, though.

00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:40.560
 Yeah.

00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:41.840
 So back up, back up a little bit.

00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:44.560
 And somebody gave us a story of how these five friends

00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:48.480
 came together and how you decided to ship coffee from the terminal.

00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:49.520
 Go ahead, Dax.

00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:52.560
 Yeah, so this is a while ago.

00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:56.640
 Prime tweeted the prime engine for those of you that are online.

00:53:56.640 --> 00:54:00.400
 He tweeted something like, "Oh, does anyone know a coffee company?

00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:02.960
 I'd love to do some kind of coffee sponsorship."

00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:05.680
 And I have two friends that own coffee roasters.

00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:06.480
 But I messaged him.

00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:09.760
 And it was kind of like, we weren't like,

00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:10.640
 "Oh, let's do this for sure."

00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:12.640
 We were kind of casually talking about it

00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:13.680
 over the course of months.

00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:17.680
 Then eventually we were like, "Okay, let's do this for real."

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:21.600
 So we got together, me, Adam, Prime, and TJ.

00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:24.640
 All of us know each other from streaming on Twitch.

00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:28.320
 And we were like, "Okay, let's do it.

00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:29.760
 Let's build a coffee business."

00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:34.640
 And then a week into it, Prime messaged just being like,

00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:36.640
 "Hey, so commentary just messaged me,

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:37.840
 and they wanted to do a sponsorship.

00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:39.520
 So sorry, like, can't do it."

00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:42.320
 I remember that last time I asked if there were any coffee companies

00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:43.920
 that wanted to sponsor me, well, there are.

00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:45.120
 Sure, sure.

00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:46.240
 Shockingly.

00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:49.200
 Yeah, so we were like, "Ah, bummer."

00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:50.560
 But you know, that is like a good opportunity.

00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:51.760
 He should do it.

00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:54.240
 So we were like, "Okay, we kind of forgot about it."

00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:56.800
 Then a few months later, he was just being like,

00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:59.040
 "This sponsorship sucks, but let's do this for real."

00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:02.000
 He just wasn't making like any money.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:02.800
 Comment here.

00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:05.280
 Just get taken straight right here.

00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:06.720
 I mean, their product is great.

00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:08.320
 I don't drink coffee at all.

00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:09.520
 That's another funny detail here.

00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:10.320
 That's another fun.

00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:10.800
 Great.

00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:12.000
 I think it's disgusting.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:12.800
 I hate coffee.

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:12.800
 Oh, wow.

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:14.640
 I'll eat coffee ice cream.

00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:15.360
 I think that's delicious.

00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:18.400
 That's the wildest part to me is the coffee ice cream.

00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:20.160
 Yeah, it's great.

00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:23.280
 So when we got together again, we're thinking it.

00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:29.920
 So the idea was the premise is one, influencers like Prime,

00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:31.440
 people are trying to do content full-time,

00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:33.760
 need a way to make money.

00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:35.280
 They need to sell something.

00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:41.600
 The people lining up to pay them are usually mediocre developer

00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:44.800
 tool companies that just don't have it.

00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:47.760
 I'm just going to be real.

00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:48.240
 Like, right?

00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:49.520
 It's not like--

00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:50.480
 Oh, no, this is great.

00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:51.360
 This is great.

00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:53.360
 And it's like, yeah, you can take those deals,

00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:55.840
 but then now people are following you

00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:57.040
 because they find you credible.

00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:57.680
 And now you're like--

00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:00.320
 It's a whole conflict of interest thing.

00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:01.520
 If there's not a cop alignment.

00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:02.640
 If you find alignment, that's great,

00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:04.160
 but it's obviously hard to find that.

00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:06.000
 But something like coffee,

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.280
 that has nothing to do with anything.

00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:08.160
 No one's going to be upset at that.

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:09.280
 Well, enough people were upset at that.

00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:11.200
 But generally, people are not going to be upset at that.

00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:13.680
 And then the second thing was,

00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:15.840
 the developer audience is big enough

00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:18.240
 that you could probably launch any kind of thing,

00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:20.320
 where if you can reach millions of them,

00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:22.160
 that's not like a sizable audience.

00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:23.760
 And it doesn't matter that you're not

00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:25.040
 competing as a coffee company.

00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:27.200
 You're like, in this other bubble.

00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:30.160
 So let's just do stuff that developers

00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:32.480
 would find funny, entertaining, et cetera.

00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:34.480
 We came across--

00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:37.280
 I use this library for SST

00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:43.120
 that helps us build really fancy terminal-based UIs in Go.

00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:46.560
 And then, so we're like, oh, let's make a CLI.

00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:48.800
 That people can download and install,

00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:53.120
 and then they can buy coffee through this little terminal app.

00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:54.560
 And then we found out the same company

00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:58.480
 builds another library that's just mount that same UI over SSH.

00:56:58.480 --> 00:56:59.840
 So then it's totally seamless.

00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:01.360
 You don't have to download it.

00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:02.800
 So I don't think there's SSH to a server,

00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:04.000
 and you get that exact same UI.

00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:08.960
 And once we came across that, it was like, oh, we have to do it.

00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:10.640
 This is obviously the way we have to do it.

00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:12.560
 And initially, we were like, oh, yeah,

00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:14.320
 we'll probably also have a website,

00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:17.120
 but it's funnier just to double down on the bit

00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:19.280
 and just say, if you can't figure this out,

00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:20.480
 we don't want your money, you know?

00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:21.680
 - It's a good bit.

00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:22.880
 I will-- it's crazy--

00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:24.640
 - But the early days, yeah.

00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:30.240
 - From a CTA or conversion perspective, it's insane,

00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:31.600
 but it's a good bit.

00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:32.800
 - It's super high friction,

00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:35.440
 so you think it was-- - Yeah, it's such a shock.

00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:36.400
 - That's what you want to do.

00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:37.040
 - It's incredibly scary.

00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:39.200
 I'm like, Aaron, is this thing going to hack me?

00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:40.080
 Are we sure?

00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:43.520
 Like, I'm like just running this command in the terminal.

00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:46.960
 Like, did I just have a doc just going through all my financials now?

00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:48.640
 And he's just like, this is great.

00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:51.520
 Like, I don't know, it's all scary.

00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:54.400
 But then there was no coffee for sale when I went in there.

00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:56.000
 So apparently, you're first--

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:56.960
 I don't know, it was the first run,

00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:58.880
 or if I was too early, but--

00:57:58.880 --> 00:57:59.680
 - Yeah.

00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:02.560
 So for the first thing, we did it in a more like--

00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:03.600
 ad hoc way.

00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:07.200
 So we went with one of my roser friends.

00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:10.960
 We picked the coffee and they literally shipped five sacks to it.

00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:14.560
 Adam was here, and my house wanted-- got delivered.

00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:15.840
 And it was a giant truck.

00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:18.240
 - Just giant bags of coffee drinks, yeah.

00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:19.040
 - Yeah.

00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:20.240
 And I think all of our reaction,

00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:21.840
 because it was going to slowly lower down.

00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:23.360
 And we were looking at it and we were just like,

00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:25.440
 that's a lot of coffee.

00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:26.960
 - What the hell have we done?

00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:27.760
 - Yeah.

00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:31.600
 - So we bagged all those first bags.

00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:33.760
 Like, we did the whole thing, you know, like shipped it all--

00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:34.480
 - Way to go.

00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:35.600
 - Vex did all the shipping.

00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:38.560
 Yeah, waited out, sealed them, not the best.

00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:40.240
 - That's the most of the boxing.

00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:44.880
 Just to give her credit, she like boxed a lot of the orders.

00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:45.760
 - That's the worst--

00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:49.680
 I did stickers once for Laravel, like eight, 10 years ago.

00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:53.040
 And it was just such an incredible nightmare.

00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:54.880
 And I'm like, shooting them all over the world.

00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:57.840
 And it's coming back to me three months later on the Liverpool

00:58:57.840 --> 00:58:59.120
 from Guatemala.

00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:01.920
 And I'm like, what, these people don't even know how to put their own address in.

00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:05.200
 Like, the incredible number of people don't know how to do their own address.

00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:07.200
 And the whole thing was just a disaster.

00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:08.880
 I was like, all right, I've never won a ship anything ever again.

00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:11.680
 So you guys got that done, it's quite impressive.

00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:12.800
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:14.400
 So that was like an initial thing is to like,

00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:17.280
 try out the concept and see if really it's--

00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:19.440
 I think with all these little things, it comes out of motivation.

00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:22.720
 Like, we knew that if we did a smaller thing and it went really well,

00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:25.040
 we'd be like really motivated to like, go to the next step.

00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:27.600
 And it worked out and we're all really excited.

00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:30.880
 So now we have a much more professional setup with my other friend,

00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:35.280
 who has like, they're going to handle a lot of the logistics for us and things like that.

00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:41.280
 But we're excited to kind of get it up and running because then just selling coffee

00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:43.840
 to the terminal, like that's-- and just having it all fulfilled and stuff.

00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:45.680
 That's like the bare bones.

00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:48.480
 But there's just so many funny things we can do with this concept.

00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:54.320
 Like, we had this idea of like, popping up a random leak code challenge while you're checking

00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:57.840
 out, and if you solve it, you get like, you know, percentage off.

00:59:57.840 --> 00:59:58.560
 They're just like--

00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:01.200
 To add more friction to the process.

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:06.960
 I'm not an expert but we might need to talk about some of this.

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:08.240
 A little bit, a little bit.

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:10.720
 But why don't you get some subscriptions in there?

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:13.520
 It's fine, because that'll have to do it once and it's fine, you know?

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:16.720
 Like, then I just get my coffee every month or week or whatever I want.

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:20.480
 So it's just an outlet for like, funny jokes and like little things like that.

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:23.600
 We're going to have a monthly box where we have a new bag design

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:29.040
 and blend every month with just like some joke for the month.

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:30.000
 I love it.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.280
 I mean, people love coffee.

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:33.120
 I mean, selling addicted substances.

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:35.280
 There's not many better businesses than that, right?

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:37.760
 Like, that's like really top tier business.

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:42.400
 Yeah, I use it to be a big coffee drinker and I do love the taste,

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:45.600
 but I haven't drank it in like 10 years, because hers is my stomach

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:47.200
 and keeps me awake and whatever.

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:48.640
 So I've been off it, unfortunately.

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:52.880
 But yeah, I can imagine you selling other things too.

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:56.080
 Like, yeah, that's what I want to hear about.

01:00:56.080 --> 01:01:00.640
 You keep hinting at like the bigger vision and I think on your y'all's last podcast,

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:03.280
 Adam was like, oh, and then, oh, I guess I shouldn't say anything.

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:04.480
 Oh, no, I can't say anything.

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:09.920
 So now that you're here where no one is listening, like what's the vision?

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.760
 What's the vision for the future here?

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:16.800
 So I think one vision is to partner with a lot of other people

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:19.920
 trying to do content full time and give them their own blends

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:23.760
 and really give them really solid cuts like a lot of these partnerships

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:24.800
 that they get for things like this.

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:27.040
 I'll make like 50 cents a bag or something.

01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:31.520
 We want to give people like a majority of the profit.

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:35.520
 Just so it becomes like a meaningful thing

01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:37.920
 that they actually care about promoting and do custom blends for them

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:39.440
 and do fun stuff with them.

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:43.680
 So that's just on the coffee side, like just scaling to anyone that

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:46.320
 wants to, that has an audience and wants to, wants to sell through us.

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:51.680
 But I know Adam's been looking at some other things as well.

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:55.520
 Well, like every time I have some stupid idea,

01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:58.720
 I just, I feel back in the back of my head saying like slow down,

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:00.480
 like just don't get ahead of yourself.

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:02.160
 It's so easy to run off with.

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:05.040
 Not a note, just like a real list.

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.480
 And like, let's take it very slow.

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:07.520
 I don't do things slow.

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:09.520
 Like I'm very like sprint.

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:10.320
 I want to go hard.

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:11.280
 Go ball in.

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:12.160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:14.640
 So I've like planned out the next six months in my mind,

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:15.520
 like what we could do.

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:18.480
 And it's, it's all kind of like pump the bricks.

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:19.440
 Let's get.

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:21.360
 No, I mean, we're not even selling coffee right now.

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:23.440
 So we got to get back to the market.

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:24.160
 Like, okay.

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:26.160
 So my wife loves coffee.

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:27.200
 I tried to buy her some coffee.

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:28.000
 I can't buy the car.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:28.480
 Yeah.

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:30.240
 So we sold out within 20 hours.

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:32.960
 The next round, it'll be like,

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:34.000
 it won't be like these runs.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.640
 It'll be continuously on demand.

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:38.560
 So I'm not going to tell you guys specifically,

01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:43.680
 but just to give context to what Adam means by when he says he just,

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:45.040
 he's like, you know, off the races.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:51.840
 He got wholesale quotes for an item that costs like hundreds of dollars per unit.

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:53.200
 Perfect.

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:53.680
 Yep.

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:56.320
 That sounds, that is so on brand.

01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:58.800
 I cannot describe how on brands that is.

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:02.800
 It's just like the first day I passed my head is like a bronze statue of Dax's head.

01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:07.600
 And it's just like, glorious to the glorious beard of bronze head.

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:09.280
 It's just like, I would buy that.

01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:11.600
 I would buy that and put it right behind me here somewhere.

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:16.320
 Like, I'm going to hazard a guess that it's that cool matte black electric kettle.

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:17.440
 That's, that's my guess.

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:20.800
 You're extremely close.

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:22.160
 It's basically, yes.

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:24.480
 I think something's for a little while.

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:25.840
 It's like, it's like, they still do.

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:26.960
 It's stuff from fellow.

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:27.200
 Yeah.

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:28.720
 Yeah.

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:30.720
 So there's like, they do like branded.

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:34.000
 They'll like, they'll like print or itch on to your, yeah.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:34.720
 So like terminal.

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:35.760
 That's pretty cool.

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:36.960
 Making gear, you bet.

01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:39.840
 Even if it's like, sometimes you got to take that energy, right?

01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:42.320
 And like, instead of like going down more products,

01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:45.360
 go down more connections of influencers, right?

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:49.280
 Like if you had 10 times more people selling just the coffee,

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:53.440
 that would also be super exciting and obviously profitable and all that.

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:56.080
 And companies, like there's some brands in the developer space,

01:03:56.080 --> 01:04:01.520
 well known that we're talking with, doing stuff, having a blend for their company,

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:02.640
 their tool or whatever.

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:03.360
 Yeah.

01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:03.440
 Yeah.

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:05.440
 There's a lot of different angles that we could go.

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:07.200
 Conferences, even or whatever.

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:09.120
 One off things for big conferences.

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:10.960
 Well, speaking of talk, can we talk about that stuff?

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:11.120
 Yeah.

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:11.200
 Yeah.

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:11.680
 Yeah.

01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:16.000
 Well, it's not confirmed, but I think we're going to show up to Larricon.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.120
 Oh, yes.

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:17.600
 Yeah.

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:18.720
 Are you going?

01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:19.920
 Breaking news.

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:20.800
 Breaking news.

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:21.680
 Nice.

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:22.880
 You aren't posting it and I'll be there.

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:22.880
 Yeah.

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:23.440
 Yeah.

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:23.440
 I know.

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:23.920
 Yeah.

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:25.920
 I imagine Aaron would go because, you know.

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:30.720
 Yes, it is in Dallas and I am hosting it.

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:32.720
 So yeah, hopefully I'll be there.

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:34.000
 I'll be there, yeah.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.440
 It's like me and React Miami.

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:38.560
 Like I make such a big deal out of it and I just haven't used React in three years.

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:40.320
 But it's convenient.

01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:45.920
 I'm already planning my empire where I'm just going to build a website

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:47.680
 that does the SSHing for people.

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:50.240
 And I'm just going to take a little cut.

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:51.520
 I'm just going to be a middle man.

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:54.240
 Even better than selling addictive substances.

01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:55.440
 It's being a middle man.

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:59.280
 No, but here you joke.

01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:02.240
 But part of what we're working on is like

01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:06.000
 the most absurdly well-designed SDKs you've ever seen.

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:10.320
 Like we're working with the people that did stripes APIs

01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:11.280
 and they have this new product.

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:16.000
 That just helped people ship SDKs that are as good as stripes.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:21.440
 So our API, which we're using, is also going to be a public API.

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:24.400
 So you can build your own coffee ordering experiences.

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:27.600
 In the weirdest place that you want, like put them wherever you want.

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:29.280
 You can put them on a website if you wanted to.

01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:34.400
 Right in my help desk product, it'll be like order more coffee.

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:42.560
 My absolute favorite part of this is y'all have been in software for so long.

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:45.920
 And you've just been looking at those sweet, sweet software margins.

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:47.600
 And you're like, that's too much.

01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:49.840
 We got to sell coffee.

01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:50.880
 Sell coffee, baby.

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:52.320
 We got to sell coffee, man.

01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:54.240
 What's in every business, right?

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:56.400
 Every business just comes down to distribution.

01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:58.240
 And so like you guys are known.

01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:00.320
 You have friends who have a lot of distribution.

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:01.360
 You have your own distribution.

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:03.440
 Like, yeah, once you have distribution,

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:05.760
 then you just find yourself into it.

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:09.360
 Right? Like it could be software, but it could be other things.

01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:10.560
 And so it's great.

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:14.000
 It's funny, like knowing all the e-commerce things

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.840
 or just like being in this space for a long time.

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:17.120
 Just being on Twitter even.

01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:20.320
 You like hear all these things like drip marketing and all this stuff.

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:21.840
 Like the stuff you're supposed to do.

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:26.240
 And it like just doesn't matter for us because Prime can like stream for two hours

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:29.760
 and get more impressions than we'd ever get with some email campaign or whatever.

01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:30.080
 Yep.

01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:33.840
 It's just a really interesting dynamic where you've got already this very active,

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:37.520
 engaged audience. We don't really have to think about like marketing

01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:38.640
 or doing that kind of stuff.

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:40.480
 It just happens kind of naturally.

01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:44.480
 And those things can be the like the optimizations later, right?

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:46.320
 Like people are trying to start with that.

01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:48.400
 But really that's your like later optimization.

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:52.000
 Because it's like, okay, once we've like we're doing so much initially,

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.800
 then eventually it's like, oh, we probably should be emailing these people

01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:58.160
 who bought from us before to buy from us again and like stuff like that.

01:06:58.160 --> 01:06:58.560
 Yeah.

01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:00.000
 But it doesn't have to be the first thing.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.160
 It's like a secondary thing after you're going.

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:08.320
 Do any of y'all listen to Nathan Barry's billionaire creator podcast or whatever?

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:09.760
 It's called, no, no, no.

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:11.680
 I don't drink coffee. I don't listen to podcasts.

01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:12.640
 Okay, perfect.

01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:13.280
 Produce both.

01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:14.640
 Yeah. Thanks for coming on the show.

01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:15.680
 Same, actually.

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:16.560
 To be honest with you.

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:18.560
 He's he's talking.

01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:20.160
 Yeah.

01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:22.800
 This is this is why I'm paired with Ian and Adam.

01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:25.520
 It's like it's perfect.

01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:26.720
 It's like such perfect.

01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:28.320
 It's like the exact same situation.

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:34.640
 It's I really am both light mode, both dark mode on that side.

01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:37.040
 Okay, focus, focus, focus.

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:42.320
 This podcast has started talking a lot about how creators already own the

01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:46.160
 distribution and are moving backwards into making brand deals.

01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:49.840
 And I feel like this is this is prime pun intended.

01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:52.960
 I guess this is this is a prime example of that where it's like,

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:57.520
 I could sell commentary for 50 cents or we could do a bunch of hard work

01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:01.040
 and get, you know, a much fatter margin on our own coffee.

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:04.320
 And I like, Steve and I are actively thinking about that.

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:06.240
 I don't, you know, I don't want to take brand deals forever.

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:07.760
 I want to own something.

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:12.000
 And so this really lines up for that in my mind.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.200
 Yeah.

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:14.720
 Yeah, no, you see it everywhere.

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:17.440
 It's almost to a degree where I'm like kind of,

01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:20.480
 I'm like, is this a good thing for the world?

01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:24.080
 Because if you go anywhere, like to any store,

01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:26.720
 there's like some product being featured.

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:28.000
 And it's always a celebrity product.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.840
 Like we are a target the other day and he's like,

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:31.840
 the rock launched his new brand.

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:35.520
 I love the rock and I think he's awesome and I'm excited for him.

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:38.240
 But like everything like all those out, like all those gin.

01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:42.480
 Yeah, like, uh, you know, there's a bunch of like alcohol companies

01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:45.040
 with celebrities and then play book, right?

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:45.360
 Yeah.

01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:45.840
 Yeah.

01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:47.600
 So it's like at this point,

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:53.040
 can you make a product without first being a, I feel we're getting to a point

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:56.240
 where it's, it's like kind of going into that direction.

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:58.160
 But yeah, it is such a crazy advantage.

01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:01.760
 Cause you're the main cost of any product is what's your cost of acquisition.

01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:04.880
 And it's basically zero when you're in this category.

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:05.840
 Yeah.

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:07.520
 I mean, the old days, right?

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:08.880
 Everything was so much more centralized.

01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:11.120
 Like, oh, I'm going to advertise in front of Seinfeld.

01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:14.160
 And I'm guaranteed 80 million people to see my product, right?

01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:16.240
 And so like that's where everything went.

01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:18.880
 But now you don't have any centralized points like that.

01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:21.440
 So it's like, okay, well, how do I get in front of people?

01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:26.480
 Well, people still pay attention to, you know, whatever their influencer is that they like,

01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:29.600
 whether it's a YouTube star or musician or whatever.

01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:33.040
 And so it's like, well, now that's how we get products in front of people, right?

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:34.320
 As we go to them instead.

01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:38.400
 And there was actually a super interesting article about McDonald's the other day.

01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:39.520
 I think it was near time or something.

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:41.760
 It was like, how like 20 years ago, everybody was like,

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:42.800
 McDonald's is the worst.

01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:43.760
 It's going to kill you, right?

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:44.240
 All this stuff.

01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:48.960
 And then they started making all these deals with like musicians and they basically did this.

01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:54.240
 And like now it's, you know, more than doubled in stock price in the last 20 years or whatever.

01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:56.800
 It's like they just had the playbook a little ahead of everybody.

01:09:56.800 --> 01:10:01.040
 But they did all these brand partnerships and influencer partnerships and all this stuff.

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:02.160
 It's not going to kill you anymore.

01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:03.680
 Now it's not going to kill you.

01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:04.960
 It's not going to kill you.

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:05.440
 It does not kill you.

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:07.200
 But somebody else got rich off of it, which is awesome.

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:11.680
 90% of America has had a meal at McDonald's in the last week or whatever, right?

01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:14.560
 So it's like literally it's like 85 or 90%.

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:18.160
 And so, yeah, so it's a bit of America's obese.

01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:19.680
 So what do I know?

01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:22.400
 No, they're surely not a correlation there.

01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:31.200
 Yeah, but I think the root of it all is we actually, we genuinely,

01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:35.360
 I don't think any of us care if this is like massively successful or not,

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:37.360
 which is very different from anything else I work on.

01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:41.280
 It's just like we all like each other and techniques used to hang out.

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:43.440
 And especially with these conference things we're doing,

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:49.520
 it's like a very easy way for all of us to get together and have it all be paid by this larger thing.

01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:53.440
 So if it's just breaking even and it's a way for us to have a good time,

01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:55.840
 it's actually all it needs to do.

01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:57.920
 But we'll see.

01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.920
 Surprisingly heartwarming from Dax.

01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:02.560
 Wasn't on my bingo.

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:04.080
 To my arm over there, yeah.

01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:06.640
 I don't need to crush the souls of my enemies.

01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:09.840
 I just want to hang out with my friends as I expected.

01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:12.240
 I'm always fascinated by business people.

01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:15.920
 And like they're like, what I do to relax is I have another business.

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:17.920
 I have this other business over here.

01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:21.840
 This is my relaxation business that's separate from my actual business.

01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:25.360
 You just see that all the time.

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:29.680
 With this type of thing, I just feel like we can't lose.

01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:31.200
 I'll give you a perfect example, right?

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:34.480
 So we shipped out all these boxes and it's the first time shipping everything out.

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:36.800
 And like people were getting them in some horrible conditions.

01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:39.760
 Like they were like, they all got crushed and looked like they got just destroyed.

01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:41.840
 But that just became a meme.

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:44.080
 My people were posting about it and it just became a joke.

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:46.960
 So it's like, we just can't lose with stuff like this.

01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:49.200
 Like let's go back.

01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:50.480
 You're coming to Larracon.

01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:52.400
 Everybody?

01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:54.400
 I know Prime is going to be speaking.

01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:55.360
 So what's the story?

01:11:55.360 --> 01:12:00.880
 So we are trying to, so basically what we did for React Miami was a little bit ad hoc.

01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:02.560
 We're trying to formalize it a little bit more.

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:06.320
 Where we show up to a conference a couple of days before.

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:10.080
 We'll do like a bunch of streaming to get people excited online.

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:15.040
 We'll do a custom blend with custom bag for people at the conference.

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:16.560
 Like they can buy it there.

01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:18.320
 They'll be in our store a week advanced.

01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:23.760
 Maybe the conference can buy a bunch to give out a speaker gift or something like that.

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:27.520
 So we just do, and then we serve the coffee there.

01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:28.480
 Oh, cool.

01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:29.920
 For the people that are there.

01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:31.520
 Yeah, I love it.

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:31.920
 Yeah.

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:37.520
 So for React Miami, like just on Twitter, we did like more than like 10 million impressions or so.

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:40.080
 And then Prime streams each day.

01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:42.320
 There were like 30 to 40,000 people that watched.

01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:46.320
 So these are like pretty crazy numbers that are hard to tap into otherwise.

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:50.480
 And we're pretty cheap for if you look at like like CPM wise.

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:53.760
 Like cuz y'all are for the friendships.

01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:55.040
 Yeah, so you don't care.

01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:55.920
 Yeah, you don't care.

01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:56.400
 Literally.

01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:57.280
 I was trying to get in.

01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:00.640
 Yeah, that covers our costs and we get to hang out for a week.

01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:01.120
 It's kind of.

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:04.880
 So are y'all going to come to the Aaron Francis studio of light and sound and do

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:06.160
 some streaming out of here?

01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:07.280
 Yeah, of course you can.

01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:08.800
 Yeah, that's such a good idea.

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:09.280
 Amazing.

01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:10.400
 Yes, of course.

01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:12.960
 That is a really good idea.

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:14.960
 Yeah, we'll get stuff now down and we'll see.

01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:18.160
 Because the big variability here is like if we do have an Airbnb,

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:20.480
 we don't know what the internet or situation is.

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:21.040
 Sure, yeah.

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:22.240
 That would be pretty helpful.

01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:28.080
 Yeah, you can't all stay here because it's literally my office and there are no beds.

01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:30.080
 But you're welcome to come up here and stream.

01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:30.640
 It's great.

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:31.200
 So it's separate.

01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:32.400
 It's not like part of your house, right?

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:33.360
 It's correct.

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:33.840
 It is not.

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:34.160
 Yeah.

01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:35.120
 Okay.

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:37.360
 You are welcome to swing by the house,

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:39.440
 but probably not stay there for very long.

01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:47.360
 It's kind of a, we got a lot going on at the house.

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:50.880
 It was wild when they were doing that in my house.

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:52.720
 It was a one of those.

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:53.200
 It looks like fun.

01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:54.400
 I watched a lot of it.

01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:55.920
 Yeah, it was super fun.

01:13:55.920 --> 01:14:01.520
 One of those friends came by to pick something up.

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:06.880
 He walks into the door and she sees prime just go up to a camera and just start like

01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:11.600
 thrusting, just a bunch of crazy thrusting maneuvers.

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:11.920
 Yeah.

01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:15.520
 And I just saw her face just being like, like what is going on?

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:19.200
 It's just because Liz's friends just do not understand what you're for a living.

01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:23.200
 Yeah, you never want one of your offline friends to walk around.

01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:25.200
 She saw that.

01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:25.840
 And that's all she saw.

01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:26.320
 And she left.

01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:27.200
 Yeah.

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:31.520
 Oh man.

01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:32.560
 Like this is how we make money.

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:34.240
 Part would like conferences and stuff though.

01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:36.240
 It's like everybody wants to see you guys, right?

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:40.320
 It's like, but how many conferences can you actually do in a year and things like that?

01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:44.080
 There are these like just limits of like, you know, what you can do.

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:46.400
 But yeah, the conference is more for fun.

01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:48.800
 Like it's just, we'll do like a once a quarter.

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:52.640
 We'll try to find a conference to do and talk together.

01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:54.000
 Yeah, basically.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.880
 But yeah, that's going to be fun.

01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:57.760
 I'm so glad.

01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:59.280
 I'm so glad y'all are going to come.

01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:04.400
 Yeah, if not, try to secure the deal tomorrow on your podcast with Taylor live on air.

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:07.200
 Be like, hey, I just wanted to check in on this.

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:08.960
 First item, first item.

01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:11.040
 Yeah, close the deal.

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:12.960
 Yeah.

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:13.280
 All right.

01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:14.080
 Are we done with coffee?

01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:16.480
 I want to hear about Adam's course or we have more coffee.

01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:18.640
 No, that's that's it for coffee.

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:21.360
 Like I said, the summary is coffee from the terminal.

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:22.320
 You can buy it soon.

01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:24.560
 I don't drink coffee, but you still trust me.

01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:25.680
 That's good coffee.

01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:29.040
 Also, this is what I said earlier about your podcast.

01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:30.640
 This is a perfect example.

01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:33.920
 It's like, hey, you do want to start a coffee company?

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:36.880
 Well, I don't actually drink coffee, but I've got four friends that are coffee groasters.

01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:37.840
 And I know this guy.

01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:41.520
 Yeah, that sounds about right.

01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:46.800
 It's at terminal dot shop.

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:47.680
 So that's where you get it.

01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:53.040
 And there's a crazy ask command line terminal that you paste in and just hope it all goes okay.

01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:53.760
 It'll be fine.

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:54.560
 Don't worry about it.

01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:57.200
 But the reason I know that's where you can't get it.

01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:58.960
 You can't get it in your terminal.

01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:03.120
 If you can't, as a sage, we don't want your money.

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:03.760
 It's a slogan.

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:08.080
 By the way, the reason I know all these people.

01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:11.120
 Adam is because I lived in a city around other people.

01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:13.280
 And it's one of the benefits of being in a city.

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:14.160
 Bringing it back.

01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:14.720
 There you go.

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:15.680
 There's two.

01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:17.280
 That's the callback right there.

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:19.120
 All right, Adam, I know all these people too.

01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:21.200
 Sorry, I know all these people from the internet.

01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:22.080
 So there you go.

01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:24.240
 You don't know any coffee or the coffee.

01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:27.040
 Yeah, no, you don't know anyone that can do anything in real life.

01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:31.120
 No, anyone that has any skills in the physical world.

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:34.320
 To know you, I get the benefits of all of those people.

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:35.120
 Yeah, no, I know.

01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:35.360
 That's great.

01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:35.840
 I'm sorry.

01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:37.440
 Someone had to live in New York, okay?

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:39.280
 In this whole chain of events.

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:39.440
 Yeah.

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:42.400
 So Adam, you are working.

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:44.880
 Are you working with Joel Hooks on this?

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:45.360
 Bad ass stuff?

01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:46.320
 I am, yeah.

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:47.200
 Okay, tell us.

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:49.040
 You're working on a full-on course.

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:50.080
 A full-on course.

01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:52.000
 It's, you know, Joel the way he puts it.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.920
 It's like a full-on small business.

01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:56.960
 It's like, I want to like teach.

01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:59.760
 I really do genuinely want that to be like as a kid

01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:01.360
 before I want to do anything, before I do anything

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:02.800
 about computers, I want it to be a teacher.

01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:04.960
 Like I want to be a college professor for some reason.

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:08.000
 I don't really, I really don't know why that specifically.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.200
 Like I didn't want to be a high school teacher.

01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:09.760
 I want to be a college.

01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:11.200
 Maybe it's a little more sophisticated.

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:13.360
 I've always wanted to teach.

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:16.080
 And I've always enjoyed like explaining things to people.

01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:18.560
 Like to a fault that, you know, it's like annoying.

01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:20.560
 People get tired of me like trying to explain

01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:21.920
 something they don't even want to learn.

01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:22.960
 That kind of thing.

01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:23.760
 So it's an outlet.

01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:26.960
 It's like, now I'm finally, I'm finally taking steps.

01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:29.600
 It's always been this thing I thought I'd get to in my career.

01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:32.000
 And I just never kind of like made the time.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.920
 I'm always busy with other stuff.

01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:35.280
 And still busy with other stuff.

01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:37.440
 But yeah, I'm pretty excited.

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:39.200
 Like we're doing kind of the first steps.

01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:42.080
 Like have a paid workshop next month.

01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:44.880
 It's kind of the first big step.

01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:45.760
 But it's going to be, I mean,

01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:47.360
 it's going to be like the rest of this year really.

01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:51.600
 Like the first full thing you could buy and like take a course

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:53.120
 will be sometime probably in the fall.

01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:54.960
 Yeah, I'm pumped.

01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:56.800
 And then I see you like you're doing a course and you're like,

01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:58.560
 yeah, we're going to, we're going to launch it next month.

01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:00.560
 Like, I'm sorry, what's that?

01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:02.720
 Aaron, how do you do it?

01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:05.200
 Well, I'm not running a startup.

01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:06.880
 And I'm not running a coffee startup.

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:07.680
 That's selling coffee.

01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:08.080
 It's true.

01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:10.800
 Yeah, so I have a little, I have a little bit more time.

01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:15.680
 And I don't follow like Joel has a very good prescribed method

01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:17.120
 where you like do a little freebie.

01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:18.880
 Then you do a course and or I'm sorry.

01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:21.280
 Then you do a workshop and then you do a bunch of emails.

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:23.520
 Like we're just not doing any of that.

01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:26.080
 And so yeah, that's the, it cuts the timeline a lot.

01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:29.280
 I do love like working with Joel.

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:32.160
 I just having someone kind of like tell me what to do

01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:34.400
 because I feel like if I were just doing it on my own,

01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:35.280
 I would never do it.

01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:36.320
 I would just never get there.

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:39.520
 But now I have like people that are like stakeholders

01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:41.680
 and like asking things of me.

01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:42.000
 Yep.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.280
 That's been very helpful.

01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:45.360
 Like I feel like I finally take real steps.

01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:48.480
 So I want to hear, I want to hear about the process of working

01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:51.760
 with them because it's, it's a very interesting business model

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:55.680
 for them where they find people like you talented creators

01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:58.640
 and like basically, you know, midwife them

01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:01.760
 through the process of creating, creating a course.

01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:04.800
 And so yeah, so like how did Joel get hooked up

01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:06.400
 and what's it been like working with them?

01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:07.520
 Because they've got a whole team.

01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:09.200
 It's like eight, 10 people over there.

01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:09.680
 Yeah.

01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:11.840
 It's, I mean, it's a lot of the Egghead folks, I think.

01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:12.800
 Like I can say that.

01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:15.920
 I mean, it's like he's got this team that has worked on

01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:18.560
 developer education for so long and together.

01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:20.400
 And like they're all effective working together.

01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:23.760
 And they just kind of like, the way he puts it,

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:26.240
 I think that I can say this is that they're like taking bets

01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:29.680
 on different creators to kind of like hit a certain niche.

01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:33.120
 So they, you know, they, they have got this team.

01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:36.640
 They do a lot of work to kind of like do the stuff

01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:37.840
 I wouldn't want to do.

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:38.640
 It's the way he puts it.

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:41.280
 Like I get to just focus on like teaching the thing

01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:45.040
 and making videos and and trying to like understand,

01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:47.120
 you know, what are my students going to want to learn?

01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:49.280
 How am I going to take them from A to B?

01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:51.360
 And then they do everything else like the website.

01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:54.560
 And they manage the live workshops and all that kind of stuff.

01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:57.760
 They sell the seeds and they do stuff that's just like,

01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:00.960
 I'm sure I would, I would spend a lot of time doing that stuff.

01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:02.880
 And maybe even enjoy it because I'm a programmer,

01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:04.240
 like building the website, that'd be fun.

01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:04.880
 Yeah.

01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:06.720
 It's so nice to not be thinking about that.

01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:10.800
 Or like building like a language or what's the word,

01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:13.520
 the learning, an Ella, learning platform.

01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:14.560
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:16.720
 Like everyone who ends up doing a course ends up building

01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:19.120
 like their own platform for teaching,

01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:20.960
 like for hosting their video course.

01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:22.720
 And they're doing that, but I don't have to do it.

01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:24.000
 So it's nice.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:24.400
 I like it.

01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:26.960
 And they send presumably they send out email,

01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:28.960
 you give them content, but they send out emails

01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:31.680
 and set up drip sequences and do all that stuff.

01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:32.800
 Yeah, did you all that stuff?

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:35.680
 They do everything except recording and editing, right?

01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:36.880
 You edit your own stuff.

01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:38.640
 I'm editing my own stuff, but you know,

01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:40.720
 they do have people for that.

01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:43.840
 Like they do have an editor that and for some of the people

01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:45.040
 that they've done courses with,

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:48.240
 all the editing was done there in-house by their people.

01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:48.800
 So cool.

01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:51.760
 That's an option. You know, I took screencasting.com,

01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:52.400
 so I feel like-

01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:52.880
 I've heard of that.

01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:53.520
 It's great.

01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:53.920
 Yeah.

01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:57.280
 I feel like I can kind of make my way around the screen flow

01:20:57.280 --> 01:20:58.720
 and I'm figuring it out.

01:20:58.720 --> 01:20:59.520
 That's amazing.

01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:00.400
 What a great domain.

01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:01.360
 That's really cool.

01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:02.080
 Yeah.

01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:02.960
 Excellent course.

01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:03.360
 Excellent course.

01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:04.000
 Yeah, thanks.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.560
 You also have not mentioned what your course is about or-

01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:07.200
 I was just gonna-

01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:08.480
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:10.320
 That's why I see people to take care of that stuff.

01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:10.640
 Yeah.

01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:13.920
 That's so good at the marketing.

01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:16.800
 So it's ProAWS.

01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:20.560
 It's basically like- so I started on AWS like 10 years ago,

01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:23.760
 but I'm very much like a practical like web developer.

01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:26.240
 I'm a startup founder.

01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:28.880
 So like I'm very- like I want to build things

01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:31.040
 and I'm not like an enterprisey.

01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:33.680
 Like a lot of the cloud is made up of like enterprise education,

01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:36.720
 like teaching very large teams how to leverage the cloud.

01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:39.680
 But there's kind of this gap for like,

01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:42.560
 I'm a small team or I'm a startup or I'm an individual

01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:44.960
 that wants to build big powerful things

01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:46.320
 and I want to leverage AWS to do it.

01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:47.920
 Like it's basically my consulting work.

01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:52.320
 So I did consulting for startups for a few years, independent.

01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:55.120
 And I'm basically doing that like taking small startup teams

01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:56.960
 and helping them leverage AWS.

01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:58.320
 So it's that angle.

01:21:58.320 --> 01:21:59.520
 It's like you're a web developer,

01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:01.040
 but you want to build on AWS.

01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:04.480
 And I know that you're too nice to brag on yourself,

01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:08.160
 but you also speed ran all of the AWS certifications

01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:11.120
 and got them all within like a month or like eight days,

01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:12.240
 something silly like that.

01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:14.160
 It's been a few years ago now, but I did.

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:17.520
 I did them in six weeks. So I did, there's like 12 of them.

01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:18.480
 I did two a week.

01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:20.320
 It was sort of like a parlor trick.

01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:22.880
 Like people ask me like, what's the value of certification?

01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:24.800
 Like how do you feel about certification?

01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:26.160
 I don't know. I don't really care.

01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:27.360
 We're talking about it now.

01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:28.000
 So it works.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:28.800
 Yes.

01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:30.720
 No, I thought it'd be like a fun like.

01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:32.080
 They made you a hero, Adam.

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:33.440
 They literally were like.

01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:35.760
 I mean, that was probably surely.

01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:36.000
 Yeah.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.360
 Yeah.

01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:38.560
 No, it was like a fun challenge.

01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:41.360
 It was like, can I, can I do these really, really fast?

01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:46.400
 Yeah, we use AWS and I feel like that's just a great course topic

01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:48.640
 because it's like an infinite source.

01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:49.120
 It's infinite.

01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:51.840
 It's so much stuff in there.

01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:53.200
 Nobody has any idea how it works.

01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:55.520
 Like you're always scared touching anything.

01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:56.560
 It's like, yeah.

01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:58.720
 And for like, if you're a web developer,

01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:01.120
 it's a very narrow slice of it that you really need.

01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:02.320
 Very small price.

01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:02.720
 Yeah.

01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:03.200
 Yeah.

01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:08.480
 So it's like just helping guide people through this very like vast landscape.

01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:08.640
 Yeah.

01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:10.800
 And like here's the stuff that matters to you.

01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:14.160
 And the thing with AWS is there's always like five ways to do the same thing.

01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:16.480
 But there's actually only one that you should pick.

01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:18.320
 And no one ever picks that one.

01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:20.960
 So again, this is just teaching them what the right one is.

01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:23.440
 Yeah, weird stuff like, do I need the API gateway thing?

01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:25.920
 And now I'm getting charged more money for some weird reason.

01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:27.120
 I don't totally understand.

01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:28.560
 And like this.

01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:28.800
 Yeah.

01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:29.360
 Yeah.

01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:30.240
 There's a lot of tricky.

01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:36.240
 I feel like this is, this is lining up exactly with my database course experience

01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:40.640
 in that a lot of like, the education is curation.

01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:43.840
 Like there's so much information.

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:49.280
 And literally 10% of it applies to like a modern web developer.

01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:54.800
 And I feel like a lot of my job is to read through everything and then figure out like,

01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:56.480
 okay, here's the important stuff.

01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:57.760
 Do you feel the same way?

01:23:57.760 --> 01:23:58.880
 Oh, yeah, absolutely.

01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:04.480
 And like the one advantage I think I'll have going into teaching this stuff is like,

01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:09.840
 I'm having a hard time getting the material done because I'm still like managing a very

01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:13.360
 large consumer site deployed on AWS that I've been building for a decade.

01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:15.840
 So like, I still do this work.

01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:20.560
 It's not like a distant thing to me that like, I don't have practical experience with.

01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:21.680
 I think that's a big advantage.

01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:25.280
 Like when you know the thing because you build on the thing, it's like,

01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:28.480
 I can't really go wrong as long as I'm staying rooted in that work.

01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:34.320
 Like I know that my advice plays out in a real world scenario because I'm living it like right now.

01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:35.200
 Yeah.

01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:36.960
 Wow, that's cool.

01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:40.240
 I'm excited for you, pro AWS.dev.

01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:43.520
 That dev, they did buy the .com for some money.

01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:44.160
 Yeah.

01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:45.760
 It just redirects to .dev.

01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:48.320
 But no, man, that doesn't give me money.

01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:49.840
 It's not the other way with the right people.

01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:56.720
 It's you're kind of like a, it's like you're signed to a label.

01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:58.160
 That's what it sounds like.

01:24:58.160 --> 01:24:58.720
 Yeah.

01:24:58.720 --> 01:24:59.280
 Yeah.

01:24:59.280 --> 01:24:59.760
 Yeah.

01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:03.360
 Or like a publishing house, like a book publisher.

01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:03.680
 Yeah.

01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:06.160
 It's a very cool model.

01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:06.960
 Yeah.

01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:08.080
 Here's a funny thing.

01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:11.520
 So Adam is using a C for the course.

01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:13.920
 I believe his course is going to do extremely well.

01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:16.880
 I think it's going to make more money than we do at SST.

01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:23.920
 Actually, we should work on some kind of deal here, I guess.

01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:26.400
 I should be giving back to the hand that feeds me.

01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:29.920
 It's amazing.

01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:31.760
 This is like the open source dilemma, right?

01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:34.560
 It's like people are making money on all your work.

01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:35.520
 And how do you?

01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:36.160
 No, it's great.

01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:37.120
 I'm not going to get that.

01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:37.600
 Yeah.

01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:38.640
 I'm actually, I don't know.

01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:39.360
 I think it's fine.

01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:40.640
 Like we're just three people.

01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:43.360
 It's not hard to find ways to sustain ourselves.

01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:44.720
 Oh, it's great exposure.

01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:45.840
 It sounds really, of course, does well.

01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:46.240
 Yeah.

01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:47.520
 It does sound hard.

01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:49.040
 Steve and I are just two people.

01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:50.880
 And we're like, oh, man, where's the money going to come from?

01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:54.320
 All right.

01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:55.760
 One last thing I forgot.

01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:56.880
 Where can blend?

01:25:56.880 --> 01:25:58.240
 It's got to, what are you going to call it?

01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:00.000
 Are you going to call it like a nambo blend?

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.040
 Or are you going to do some things?

01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:01.520
 There's some things.

01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:02.560
 There's some ideas.

01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:03.760
 I don't think we should leak it yet.

01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:04.160
 Yeah.

01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:05.920
 We don't know what it is.

01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:06.720
 We don't know what it is.

01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:08.240
 If you have any ideas, please send it to us.

01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:11.520
 Because obviously, we don't know what makes for a funny joke.

01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:12.880
 Well, David is a layer of developers.

01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:14.240
 David is a layer of developers.

01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:15.360
 You do have one.

01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:18.240
 He's been great to like ideate on this front.

01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:20.800
 But yeah, we could use any more ideas.

01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:21.280
 Throw them out.

01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:24.480
 Well, if you need a vibe check before you go to press,

01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:25.680
 just send it to me and Ian.

01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:27.600
 And we'll tell you like, oh, that's going to work.

01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:28.480
 Or that's not going to work.

01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:32.080
 Maybe we should make fun of PHP developers.

01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:33.360
 Maybe that should be the angle.

01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:36.480
 Like I said, like I said, I need a vibe check.

01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:40.240
 Send it to us before you print it and we will help you.

01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:43.760
 What an interesting idea.

01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:45.360
 There's a lot of subtleties in there though.

01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:47.360
 There's like, some people just consider themselves

01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:49.520
 layer of all developers and not PHP developers.

01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:52.960
 And so there's a whole, there's internal factions.

01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:53.440
 Internals.

01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:55.840
 I feel like there's some very obvious names

01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:57.680
 for what we would do that people--

01:26:57.680 --> 01:26:59.120
 That's definitely a couple of things.

01:26:59.120 --> 01:26:59.600
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:01.280
 There's a couple of them very obvious.

01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:05.040
 Do you remember the funny error that we always used to get

01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:05.600
 in PHP?

01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:09.200
 Unexpected like T-puneo Nuko D item or what that was?

01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:11.520
 Yeah, it's like a Hebrew word.

01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:13.280
 Yeah, there's just like this random Hebrew word

01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:15.120
 because like the initial developers,

01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:17.200
 where there's a lot of like Israeli developers and stuff.

01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:20.080
 And like, there's this one error you would always get in PHP.

01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:22.080
 I can't remember it, but it's a pretty word.

01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:23.040
 That's what it means.

01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:24.000
 It means nothing.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.040
 You know what it means?

01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:27.520
 I didn't even know it was like a Hebrew word for like 20 years.

01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:29.600
 Or like 10 years probably.

01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:31.760
 It's just like, what the hell does this mean?

01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:32.320
 Oh, man.

01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:36.720
 I don't know if it's like a bad ink tea or kamiyam nikkadotiyam?

01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:37.920
 Yeah, that really is.

01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:38.720
 Yeah, that's it.

01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:39.760
 I think it's an unequal--

01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:40.640
 Maybe it's an unequal--

01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:44.400
 No, I think it's an unexpected double semi--

01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:45.040
 Double colon?

01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:45.600
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:46.400
 Double colon.

01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:48.240
 So we gotta put that in the bag somewhere.

01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:49.040
 That's a nice thing.

01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:50.480
 Yeah, you can put that in the bag.

01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:52.240
 Yeah, that's for the old head.

01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:54.880
 That will show everyone at a PHP conference

01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:56.400
 that like, you're one of us.

01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:57.760
 You are one of us, yeah.

01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:01.520
 If the blend is called Teapownukudayum or whatever it is,

01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:03.040
 everyone will be like, holy crap.

01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:08.560
 You're from before the linters and the IP fix everything,

01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:09.600
 or you and everything.

01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:11.920
 Like, you're just in there in a text editor,

01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:13.440
 like hocking around and--

01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:14.960
 Hey, that's actually true.

01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:16.160
 I did PHP for it.

01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:16.800
 Yeah.

01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:17.040
 Really?

01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:18.000
 It's a year.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:18.480
 There you go.

01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:19.520
 I've had a long time ago.

01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:19.600
 There you go.

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:20.000
 One of us.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.120
 It did it a long time ago.

01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:21.520
 Yeah, yeah.

01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:22.560
 One of us.

01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:23.520
 PHP's the greatest.

01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:24.480
 It's the whole city.

01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:25.600
 That's good.

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:27.040
 We'll get sure to put that printed on there.

01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:27.760
 It's just, though.

01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:29.600
 Yeah, there we go.

01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:31.360
 I find that on Terrible.shop.

01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:32.320
 Honestly.

01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:34.480
 And it's going to be two customers right there.

01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:35.440
 Karen, but I don't know.

01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:38.000
 Yeah, we got this all the lead code to check out, so.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.560
 No, I don't want to do that real programming.

01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:42.480
 You're going to lose a lot of this in that one.

01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:45.440
 I'll open it up in the eyes.

01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:47.200
 Only-- it is kind of funny to have

01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:49.520
 like certain items that only people smart enough

01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:51.760
 can get those items and stuff.

01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:53.680
 Like, we haven't got any of them, but that'll be fun.

01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:55.120
 It's fun when it's out there.

01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:58.000
 Another version of this joke was there's

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.160
 like different levels to those lead code challenges.

01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:02.560
 We were thinking that randomly we'd

01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:06.720
 drop in like an extra hard one, and if you got it right,

01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:08.960
 we would increase the price instead of decrease it,

01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:14.720
 because clearly, clearly, you're going to afford it.

01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:16.240
 I thought you were going to say, like,

01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:18.160
 you personally deliberately or something.

01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:18.720
 Like, you just--

01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:20.160
 No, no, no.

01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:24.800
 We just didn't feel bad for spending the time to do it.

01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:26.480
 You spent two hours solving this.

01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:27.440
 That's too bad for you.

01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:30.960
 It's $52 to buy your coffee.

01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:33.520
 It's gracious.

01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:35.520
 All right, well, thanks a lot, guys, for coming on.

01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:36.320
 This was awesome.

01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:37.440
 Yeah, it's a fun thing for having us.

01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:38.080
 It worked great.

01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:38.640
 Of course.

01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:39.200
 Thanks, Adam.

01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:39.920
 Thanks, Dax.

01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:43.120
 We'll be interacting with you on Twitter, I'm sure.

01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:45.680
 And so check out there.

01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:46.160
 There's a step.

01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:49.200
 We'll link it all up below with terminal.shop with coffee

01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:52.000
 and how about tomorrow podcast.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.600
 So yeah, check all that stuff out.

01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:57.440
 And SST news.

01:29:57.440 --> 01:29:59.760
 Yeah, whatever SST is.

01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:00.960
 I am jealous.

01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:02.000
 Whatever I look at.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:03.280
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:04.720
 I love the idea of the bit.

01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:05.480
 But--

01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:08.760
