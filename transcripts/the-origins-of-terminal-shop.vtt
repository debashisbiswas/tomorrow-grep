WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400
 it's amazing. I truly am better than everyone else. You really are. It's wild. Look at that self-control.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:42.480
 Oh hey. I wasn't looking. Are you eating cereal? I was just kind of flushing it out of my mouth with

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:51.120
 some water. What kind of milk do you put in your cereal? Soy milk. Go ahead. Go ahead. I'm braced

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:59.200
 for it. Sometimes I don't milk, but mostly we get oat milk for my youngest who prefers it. I mean,

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.480
 it's better. It's sweeter as sugar in it. It's delicious, but I stick to soy milk.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:10.800
 I mean, I've told you the thing that ruins oat milk, right? No. It's got a higher glycemic index than

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.520
 a can of Coca-Cola. Oh, geez. Okay. Yeah. That does ruin it for me. I wonder if my

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.960
 four-year-old loves it. He said that I was like, yeah. I just get him some Coke, I guess.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.640
 To be honest, it doesn't taste to me. It's really weird because I'm like, this definitely

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.760
 isn't taste as good as a Coke. Like all the glycemic index without the taste of Coke.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.640
 Yeah, not the benefits. I did use to love Coke. I haven't had soda in a long time.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.200
 Oh, really? But I always enjoyed it. It's like certain foods that I really miss,

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.000
 Coke. Any kind of Italian marinara stuff, I always loved Coke with spaghetti or pizza.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.040
 It's so good. I replaced it with kombucha. That's true. You know, the kombucha that I gave you,

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:03.200
 the green apple one, that to me just tastes 100% like soda. It's like fizzy, it's sweet.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.960
 It's to me exactly as good as soda. And I'm like, there's no way that this,

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.080
 nothing in life is like that. Nothing in life is like, these two things are exactly as good,

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.000
 and one is good for you and one is bad for you, right? No, there's usually a trade-off.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.440
 This is okay. Yeah. I will say there's not really like another drink I've had that kind of like

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:30.480
 has that dark soda, like Coke taste. Like I drink a lot of Mountain Dew growing up,

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.440
 and I do feel like the pineapple kombucha one-to-one replacement, like I feel good about it.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.600
 But if you want that like dark cola taste, soda or pop, we talked about this in Florida,

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.160
 all the different names. What do you guys call it? We call it soda. Well, some people

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.240
 in the Ozarks call it soda pop. Sorry. We're awful. We're the armpit of America. Sorry.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:58.320
 No, I mean, you were telling us about the really funny thing where Casey calls everything a Coke,

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.640
 even if it's not a Coke. Yeah, no, that's when I first married her. She's

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.880
 since acclimated to the Ozarks and she does just call it soda now. Now she calls it soda pop.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.640
 We don't really say the word a lot because we don't drink. We don't drink it. But yeah,

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.400
 everything in the south, like she's from Atlanta, everything is Coke. Like what kind of Coke you want?

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:25.120
 Uh, Sprite. It was really, it seemed really rammed me until I remember that like Atlanta's

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.880
 where Coke's here isn't everything. So it checks out. It's so funny how cities like take on the

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.400
 identity of like the biggest company in them. Like it's such a big part of the culture in any

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.840
 given city, like the biggest mega corporation there. Like the stadium's always named after it.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.400
 It's like there's this weird hometown pride about buying the product from the company that

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.600
 is based there. But it makes sense. I mean, it's tribalism probably at its finest, I guess.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.960
 And a lot of people like probably work there and that's where they make their money and all that

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.320
 stuff. I never actually lived anywhere that was like that because growing up everywhere I'm from

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.280
 their parents worked in New York and they can you did New York, obviously. Everything. Yeah.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.880
 That's when I lived in New York and yeah, no one thing. Here in Miami, there isn't really anything

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.480
 either American Airlines, right? Isn't that what we did have? We did have the arena was called

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.880
 American by the American. I just go by the arenas. I think they were based there. Yeah,

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.520
 I don't think they would. I don't think they would do the stadium deal. Otherwise I guess.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.440
 I don't know. Maybe not. That seems weird to me. Well, not just I'm a search away from knowing

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.840
 the answer. So I'm going to know the answer. Just Miami doesn't feel very American, you know.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:42.240
 Yeah, the least American city. American Airlines base. I should know this. My brother is a pilot.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:51.120
 Headquarters for Delta. Yeah, for Delta for Texas. Well, then why did they? Huh. Oh, Miami. They also

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.160
 have crew bases and Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas, Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Miami. Okay, this just

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.760
 got really stupid. I don't need to keep reading. It's like every city. Yeah. Well, they renamed

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.680
 the American Airlines to the FTX arena. And you know, the whole FTX thing happened. Wait, FTX?

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.320
 Like, yeah, they bought it from they like bought it out from American Airlines. That's the guy,

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.640
 right? The curly headed. What's his name? Yeah. What's his name? Yeah. It's also SBF. There's

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:23.600
 some more acronyms. So they had it and their thing blew up. And then the arena was like,

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:31.280
 like we didn't get all the money up front. So this is a problem. And it's crazy because you

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.320
 think, Oh, it's just the name, you know, it's the thing on the outside. But like every single piece

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:42.720
 of material, like all the napkins, every sign, like every little spot that you can bring something

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.320
 has FTX on it. And now someone else bought it. And I just like, the name is so hard to remember.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:54.800
 Kite Casa center. What? What is that brand? I guess good job getting a stadium. So maybe

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.240
 people will know what your thing is. Because I've never heard of you kidding me. What?

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:04.160
 Because say a IT and security management for IT professionals, like we've never even heard of

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.320
 it. I mean, I guess it's that corporate world. There's like a corporate IT world that we just

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.160
 don't overlap with at all. But you're you're actually right because it seems like they're based in Miami.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.680
 That whole world, just like the like every time you go to an airport and you see the signage,

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:23.200
 like all the IT signs are like, what is that company? What did they do? Like IBM just bought

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.240
 what they just buy? How should corporate how should corporate is not a random company?

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.480
 No. How should corporate not random? But like, what does IBM do anymore? Like they still exist?

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:36.480
 IBM is so crazy. My friends used to work there. So I got like to peer inside. It is a it is so

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.080
 weird. It's just okay. Actually, I think I can explain it really, really easily.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:45.680
 Every company in the world is now a tech company because you need to employ and build

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.800
 texture. Even if you're like manufacturing peanuts. I don't know. That's the wrong word.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:57.360
 Manufacturing peanuts. Yeah. We make peanuts here. We know this is just like picked from tree peanuts.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:03.200
 It's like you need software engineers to like, you know, build stuff for the logistics and everything.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:09.200
 And these companies just hire IBM. They're just like, hey, IBM, like tell us what to do. And there's

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:15.040
 this giant army of IBM consultants that just push a bunch of like weird bullshit. And it like,

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:20.480
 kind of like does something, but it's usually like kind of useless or inefficient and they have

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:25.360
 like all these weird things around it. So it's like, yeah, they have a bunch of technology. They

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:31.200
 have like a cloud. They have cloud products. They're all horrible, but they have this massive consulting

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:37.200
 arm that just does these things. And it's funny, like their whole marketing thing is their marketing

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.920
 is all scams, in my opinion. It's just like, and so for some reason, we don't call it that.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:48.560
 Like they'll do something like Watson AI is curing cancer and they'll do some like crazy partnership

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:55.280
 with some like cancer notable clinic. Yeah. And it'll be like big and splashy when they

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.880
 announce it. And then if you actually like follow these projects, they're just like,

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.360
 like they're nothing like nothing. There's nothing that happens. And they're like useless or like,

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:09.520
 they just do these like PR and marketing dollars. Yeah. Yep. Wow. And that gets them like business

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:14.240
 for consulting. And they also, it's they also make like a billion dollars a year on just real estate

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:20.320
 stuff, just because they're like, so big. And they release their office space. They're also crazy

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.560
 patent troll. They suit, they make like a bunch of money every year just from chasing

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:30.400
 patent stuff. It just like, oh my word, just like a company deep in death. But you know,

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.640
 the death can last that that's the thing for a hundred more years. Yeah, companies,

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.880
 it's such a slow death. What's the parallel? Because I've read books, there's that book scale,

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.880
 I think. I don't remember. There's a book. Those are talking about cities are unkillable.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:48.080
 Right. Like cities live forever almost. But like businesses are like people, they die.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.920
 That was a realization for me. But then like, I'm trying to think, but some businesses don't.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:56.720
 Yeah. Yeah. But some they don't. What is the parallel with a human that is like IBM? Like,

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:00.800
 who is the human version of IBM? You know what I'm saying? I guess our politics are made up of,

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:06.320
 I'm going to say, yeah. Huh. For our international listeners. Well, they're probably all the same,

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:11.040
 all over the world, whatever, the US is like all old people, like all the politicians are old people

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.600
 in America. And that's just a fact. I'm not old-chaining. Picking around forever. Yeah.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:24.320
 I just want to write off that entire enterprise everything. It's just like irrelevant to me.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:28.880
 And then I'm like, oh, that's pretty reductionist or something. Is that the right word? It's just like

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:33.760
 very naive of me or something to be like, that stuff doesn't matter when it's like most of the

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:40.320
 global economy, probably. Yeah. It's just, I mean, it's one of these situations where if you take,

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:45.440
 again, I'm going to stick with this. I say the largest peanut manufacturer in the world.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.840
 Let's go with coffee. Can we do coffee manufacturers?

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:54.480
 Yeah. Oh, I actually learned a bunch about this too recently. Like, they're probably a company

00:09:54.480 --> 00:10:00.480
 that's been around for 100 years. And they probably own massive physical things in the world.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.680
 Yeah. Just land. Like just physical warehouses they have.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:09.200
 The factories. And this business is probably horribly run by modern standards. It could

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:14.720
 probably be like a factor of 10x more efficient and I make 10 times as much money. But it's

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:20.000
 literally impossible to spin up some way to like there's like no angle to attack them with something

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.800
 new. So on one hand, yeah, like you're right. Like that's a huge part of the world. But on the other

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:32.640
 hand, it's like it's not representative of anything of the way the world should be really. They're

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:39.600
 just like a legacy. They're factored in to like, you know, they start this business at the right

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.680
 time and it's going to be around forever just because of that. Yeah. And I'm sure this applies

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:50.560
 to like every industry, but I feel like I can more like more safely criticize tech stuff,

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:55.760
 not safely, but like it's a little more appropriate. I feel like I know something about software.

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.440
 So when there's companies like IBM that do what they do, I'm just like, that doesn't matter.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.960
 Yeah, because they have a cloud and like we know being like experts in that space,

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:06.480
 we know it's like 100% garbage. There's like nothing evaluated.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:12.560
 Yeah, it's not an aversion to big companies like Amazon. Great. AWS relevant.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:20.560
 IBM not. So it's just like the legacy. There's there's legacy stink all over a company like that.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.320
 So you said you said coffee manufacturers. So

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:29.520
 in our call, in our call that you missed because you refuse to sacrifice your body. Oh, who are you

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:34.080
 all on that call? Is that the only one that missed that call? No, just me TJ and Liz.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:38.080
 Okay, because I feel like we need like a team call. I feel like we need to all sink at some point.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.040
 We'll do it next week. Okay. I just don't want to introduce like overhead because every time I

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.840
 think of something like that, I'm like, Dask can be like, no, we don't need calls. We can just

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:49.360
 anything like you're right. No, we can have them as needed. It's just, I just never want to put

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.000
 anything on the calendar that's recurring. Yeah, I think half of it's just like, sorry,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.200
 it's not even a recurring thing. I think half of it's just like, we just had a moment. It'd be

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:59.360
 nice to just like, hang out, just talk a little bit. No, and I want to do that. It's just like,

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.640
 we're like, oh, yeah, no, I'm not rushing. Oh, you're good. Okay. Continue your story.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:07.920
 But next week. So anyway, we talked to for context for everyone, we talked to

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:15.600
 our roasting partner and he was just giving us so much like, interesting information about

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:21.520
 the coffee industry. And he was saying that, well, he's going to explain the economics of the whole

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:25.680
 thing because we were talking about like, you know, what it takes to make the thing of folders,

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:31.040
 which is like, you know, the cheapest coffee you can get. And he was describing the process of

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:37.520
 so the coffee that he gets, it's handpicked. Like there's literally someone like picking

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:42.640
 the beans by hand, like one by one. And it takes him, I think he said a day to pick a pound of coffee.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:47.600
 Wow. It's not like this massively efficient process. But then the people that these like

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:53.840
 massive coffee companies, they literally just have these machines that go out and just like

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:58.960
 do this automatically, but they're literally getting like branches, bird's nests, like all

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:06.000
 this random crap in there. And like, then it's like obviously like crazy process in a similar way.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 And there's all this error that happens. No, I mean, it doesn't like there's only so much you

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.080
 can do. So you're literally getting that stuff in your, and he also mentioned that,

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:23.040
 Oh, and they also over like burn it. They basically like roasted way too hard. Yeah.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:29.120
 To the point where he's like purify it. Because it's so gross. I think it's like, yeah, like they

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:33.840
 can't afford margins of error. So there's like, you know, like gross the hell out of it to get this,

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:39.120
 like, huh. So and maybe like last longer or something when you when you do it that way.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:43.440
 What a point is that these are optimizing for are not related to taste or like quality,

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:49.200
 right? And you also mentioned that they roasted so aggressively that there's some way to measure

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:56.640
 this. It's like how long something burns for it has like a higher point than than wood.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:01.360
 It like if you like burn a piece of wood. Yeah, if you have burn a piece of wood and burn like

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:06.080
 the cool amount of this like coffee, the coffee would burn longer. It's just like this really

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:10.560
 messed up process. And then he was saying that the coffee farmers in South America,

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:15.600
 the average age of 65, because the next generation just hasn't really been able to find a way to

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:21.360
 compete against that type of thing. That's where your tweet came that we're going to run into

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:25.360
 problems with not enough people. No, that was actually before. No, that was actually I tweeted

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:29.840
 that before. Oh, okay. No, it's not that I don't have people. It's just that like because these

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:34.800
 bigger companies just do run that process and sell the coffee for super cheap. They just haven't

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:40.960
 been able to make. There's not as much opportunity for like people doing it in this more direct way.

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:46.560
 What happened? Yeah, with like livestock in America, like the big mega players kind of took over and

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:52.720
 it's less family owned farms, I guess. Yeah. And they're still there and they still will be,

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:57.280
 but obviously it's like a smaller number than before. But at the same time, the demand for

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:03.760
 like better quality coffee is also going up. Yeah, which is why the operations like his are like

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:08.800
 are important for that for that industry and operations like ours. Let's talk about it. I just,

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:13.440
 all I could, we can talk about in terminal the entire podcast and people can just deal with it.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:18.720
 Like we're having some fun right now. And there's probably a lot to discuss even,

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:23.680
 I don't know how much we want to talk about, but well, we're pretty open around here. We're

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:27.440
 we'll talk about it all, right? There's nothing secret. I don't want to give away anything that's

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:32.160
 going to be a surprise. Like I don't want to. Well, yeah, no, like things that are to be announced

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:37.120
 things we won't talk about. Yeah, I don't know. We just had kind of like a an online moment.

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:42.480
 I think we, well, I don't remember on our last podcast, what had just happened? I guess did we

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:48.320
 launch before that podcast? We just we had just launched. We hang on. We didn't go for sale with

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:54.400
 the first bags, right? We had just like announced it at React Miami. But since then we opened it up

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:58.080
 for sales, right? Yeah, because we opened it up on Monday this week, man. It's funny. Whenever

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:03.360
 you do a launch, I just happened to see also whenever you do a launch, you're like, oh, yeah,

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:07.760
 we launched three weeks ago, but it was like, no, you launched like two days ago. It's been a long

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:14.400
 week. There's just so much stimulus coming out here that it just blows down time or speeds up.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:19.760
 Yes. So since the last podcast, we launched sales. We can talk about that. That's that's new

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:29.280
 information. Yeah. Yeah. So we launched on Monday and we sold out by Tuesday. Yeah, it's in 24

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:36.080
 hours, right? Which is great. Yeah. And that's us only. Sorry. Yeah. There's us only a lot of

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:40.960
 people begging us, please ship to Canada. Please ship to Brazil. So far away. Sorry.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:47.520
 My biggest issue in life is that everybody I like doesn't live next to me. I know, right?

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:53.120
 Like the whole globalization thing's great until you're like, what if I want to be in the same

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:58.240
 vicinity as people? I know. That's the only part they haven't figured out. If teleportation were

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:02.640
 just a thing, it'd be amazing. I know. Why can't everyone just live where I want to live? So I will

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:08.320
 say Casey and I may have found a solution to our problem, which is we built this amazing house that

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:13.760
 we love. It's our dream home. And then we realized we could build it again, like the exact same house

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:18.800
 in South Florida. Like, why not? Like, we'd still have our house. It'd just be like, our kids wouldn't

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:22.400
 even know the difference. They'd just like walk outside and be like, this is different. But like,

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:26.000
 mostly they wouldn't notice. We're doing it. You guys are crazy. Yeah, we'll see.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:34.480
 We love the house. It's like, if we just had it down there, we know the best of all the

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:39.440
 world. Anyway, that is so funny. It's out of doing that, you should just like lift your house and

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:45.280
 travel. There you go. Put it on a few trailers and just really love our house.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:52.640
 This specific one. Yeah. So the reception was really crazy. Like we got like the amount of

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:58.240
 like went really viral yesterday. It was on top of Hacker News. We were actually waiting to

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:02.720
 submit to Hacker News till later, but someone sent it and like we were at the number one slot

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:08.960
 for a good amount of time. Hundreds of comments. I just looked at this morning. It's the points

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:12.560
 on our posts. And I'm not a big Hacker News guy, so I don't have anything to put it

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:19.440
 into context. But it was a lot. I don't know. Now I sound like a nerd.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:24.720
 Like I'm... No, I did really well. It did really well. And on Twitter, people are very excited.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:31.840
 Very excited. Our Twitter account is at like 10k almost already. It's probably hitting 10k right

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:36.960
 now. Followers. There's crazy amount of impressions every week we post is going insane.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:45.200
 So really exciting launch. Yeah. So that's really good. I'm very annoying.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:49.840
 So my reaction to it is like that's good, but you know, it's kind of what I expected.

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:54.000
 No, yeah. I mean, it's definitely like... There's a part of me that kind of like wishes it didn't

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:00.240
 maybe go quite so insane right off the bat because I do... I'm leery of the like flash in the pan.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:06.240
 Like there's downsides to this kind of thing. And like we're trying to build a real business here.

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:09.840
 This isn't just like a marketing stunt. There's a lot of people that I feel like

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:16.560
 their reception was sort of like, wait, oh, it's not a joke? Oh, like you're actually selling coffee?

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:22.080
 Like no, we're actually trying to build a real business here. Yeah, exactly. And like I think

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:26.800
 it'll be fine. Like I think I think the next round when we actually... The plan is we're going to

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:31.840
 open it up to once we have our process in place, it's not going to be this like, oh, we're selling

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:35.920
 X-number of bags. We just have... You can order whenever you want. We roast every week and we ship

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:42.640
 every week continuously. I don't... I think it'll take us a while to get back to this many orders,

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:49.120
 but I don't think it's going to be like... I think it's something that'll just grow over time,

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.760
 but I just really need to like see all the numbers and look at like,

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:56.000
 just the standard process we run with everything else. I just need to be able to do that with this.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.200
 And then I'll kind of understand a little bit better. But yeah, so it was really good that I got

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:05.440
 a lot of attention, but it's all about reordering and people forming a habit around this thing,

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:10.160
 which takes time. Yep, but it's very exciting. And people are really funny. We got some really

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:14.800
 funny, funny replies, things that we're going to steal from our own marketing, for sure.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:18.160
 That's the best part about like getting attention on the internet is you just steal

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:21.680
 everybody's ideas when they like throw them at you. Like, here's good ideas.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:29.600
 Yeah. Awesome. On the negative side, or not negative, just like a funny reality of the world.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:34.880
 So I was telling you yesterday, so I've been talking about this thing where like my

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:39.840
 big place got my barbecue from Kamado Joe, where I'm like, man, that's just a great business. You

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:44.480
 go in every day, you just do this really wholesome thing and people love your product and it's great.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:49.200
 And I was like, imagining that. I was like, oh, this coffee thing is very similar. Like, yeah,

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:53.520
 we're just selling coffee. You know, a lot of people like coffee through the terminal. It's

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:58.960
 fun. It's goofy. Like, it's not serious. Yeah. And then I realized, you know what, I was painting

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:04.560
 like a very rosy picture of the other thing, because no matter what it is, no matter what

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:10.080
 your thing is, no matter how silly or stupid or non-serious your thing is, you just get haters

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:16.000
 and I don't understand. It's like so mind-blowing to me that even this, okay, my robot SST, I get it.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.440
 Like, you're an annoying engineer. You just agree with something I say. You're going to be annoying.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:23.680
 Yeah. I totally get that. But that happens again with this stuff.

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:29.920
 Yeah. It's like mind-blowing. Like, it's just, how can you have any kind of, again, most people,

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:33.600
 even if they are not, they're not going to buy from us, even if like, whatever, they're like,

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.240
 this is cool. Congratulations, guys. Like, a very normal response.

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:41.040
 Yeah. But then like, every once in a while, you should be like, oh, you guys just wrapped

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:46.640
 Charm Seal line called it a product. Like, that looks funny to me. No, I'd say anyone using any

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:53.200
 library ever, like, oh, you just wrapped, you know, like, never mind the bagging the coffee beans

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:59.760
 and all the many, many things that went into this. I mean, like, lots of time and effort and thought

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:04.720
 and creativity went into this. But yeah, we basically just wrapped a library and built the business.

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:09.040
 It's one thing where, like, the library has nothing to do with coffee or anything. It's like going to

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:18.720
 air B&B and being like, you guys just wrapped the reaction. That one I didn't even, that didn't

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:22.800
 even register for me. But it is funny. The people who, like, keep, it's like they're following you

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:27.840
 around. Everything you do, they're like, they're on every medium. Like, there's this, there's this

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:32.080
 person that's very convinced that we're going down because we're doing illegal things because

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:37.360
 that's the stage is not secure. And here's why. And he's like following us on literally every platform.

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:41.360
 Like, don't worry, this is all going to go away. Like, no one was worried. Like, no one is expecting

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:46.400
 it to go. What is your problem? It's like, he really needs to see it fail. It's like part of his

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:50.480
 identity. And it's funny because when I see people like that, I'm like, Oh, this is what prevents,

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:55.840
 like, you think of everyone has ideas, but taking an idea to zero to making it happen. There's just

00:22:55.840 --> 00:23:00.000
 so many things that can get in your way. And like, so few people really, you know, follow through on

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.160
 these things. And when I see stuff like that, it makes me realize like, Oh, there's just so many

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:09.040
 ways you can just sabotage yourself. Like a big part of business launching anything

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:14.480
 is ignoring the rules and getting to a place where if you're successful, then you can deal

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:22.000
 with it. So in our case, does Stripe explicitly say, yes, you can collect credit card information

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.240
 through SSH? No, they don't. They don't explicitly say anywhere. Because why would they ever have

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:29.920
 considered this flow? Like, obviously, maybe, maybe literally no one has ever done this before.

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:34.960
 Yeah. But you know, they do provide a way to support this kind of thing more generally.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:40.080
 You don't have to use their widgets. You can collect the details yourself and tokenize it

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:45.680
 through their API. Like, it's a very standard thing that they support. That said, they might

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:50.880
 still come back and say the specific way you're doing it is, you know, it doesn't work. Like,

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:54.080
 you know, you guys need to do that. If they say that, we'll come, we'll go, yeah, we've got

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.960
 you were actually even planning more than one planning on changing up. Yeah. Yeah.

00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:01.680
 We're like, there's so many different flows that we can do. But so many people out there will just

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:08.240
 get stuck on things like this and not progress. They'll be like, well, technically, that's probably

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:13.200
 wrong as well as a black and white thing. Yeah. Instead of realizing, no, you can launch and then

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:16.640
 get somewhere and then like figure out later and then get to the next point. Someone in New

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:20.560
 Bronx, I figured that's just how all this stuff works. And there's, I think people, a lot of people

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:24.720
 are just so like, it's just not natural for them to think that way. Yeah, there's also like,

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:30.000
 the people who will just immediately hate this new thing because of the people behind it. Like,

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:36.240
 there'll be people who don't like individuals like you or prime, you know what I mean? Like somebody

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:43.440
 that like is on the wrong side of the social graph and they're just not happy to see us do

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:49.680
 anything. So there's that too. There's five of us like we have enemies. So yeah, it's interesting.

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:55.760
 Like we all have a lot going on. This is not our main thing. But you like bring us all together

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:59.600
 and we're all kind of it's just so fun. Like it's just so fun creating new things and doing it with

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:04.800
 different people and especially just like a small group of very talented people that everybody is

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:09.120
 good at what they do. There's just something electric about that. Like, you know this, you've

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:13.120
 worked in small teams, you're working on another small team right now. There's nothing better in

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:18.320
 life. Like I used to think I enjoyed like solo work. I did a lot of independent work. No, it's small

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:22.880
 teams. That's the dream. It's funny. So me and Liz were talking about us yesterday and she was

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:29.120
 like, Oh, this is the first time I am working on a competent and talented team. Yeah, because you

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:33.280
 can work on a small team where everyone's an idiot. Oh, yeah, sure. Again, so the default. And she's

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:36.880
 like, yeah, every single person is like really, really good at what they do. And you can just trust

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:42.720
 them to go and do it. And to be honest, my first experience with that was also with SSC. Like it's

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:49.360
 also a new experience for me. And it's so funny because once you're in it, and you like work that

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:54.640
 way, then you look at all the conversations about like, here's how to build a team. Here's the

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:59.120
 process you need. And just like, you just realize everyone's just compensating for sucking. Yeah,

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:03.920
 basically. It's so true. But you need literally nothing when your team is good,

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:10.960
 right? Like so little, you need like a general correct decision. But like all the details are

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:14.560
 so broad. Like people just grab things and go and it comes out good. Like you need like all the

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:19.600
 stuff people spend all their time talking about like, like should we do agile? Should we do this?

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:24.400
 Like is remote work? Okay, like how do you need to over communicate? There's all these like stupid

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:30.800
 things are just like so irrelevant. Have really good people. Yeah, I know. It's just so funny when

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:35.200
 you're on the other side, just like, man, it's so it's so great that really none of that matters.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:40.080
 Yeah, it's the best. And I was thinking that's actually actually how you because everyone's like

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:43.520
 every single company is like, our team is so good. We only hire the best people.

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:48.320
 Every single team, 100% of companies only hire the top 10% of people. Every single company says

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:53.840
 that. But it's so easy to measure. Just measure how much process you have. Yeah, like if you guys

00:26:53.840 --> 00:27:01.920
 are talking about like, I don't know, just like the exact pull request process that you need to

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:06.720
 follow. Meanwhile, we have five people just eating shit straight into the main branch and not even,

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:12.480
 you know, it just doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. I regret I'm sorry that I created a to do

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:18.000
 that markdown file. Because it just needs to be deleted. I don't think we've used it. I kept trying

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.560
 to read three things and I was like, never mind, I don't need this stupid. I mean, I did a bunch

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:29.040
 of that too. Like you use recreate process over and over. And it's an instinct. Yeah, it's uh,

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:35.440
 it really is like a unique collection. I feel like the skill set on our team. I do feel like

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:40.880
 when I think about like the excitement around it, it's like, oh, you could like raise off this

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:47.280
 excitement. I'm my first start. We raised off of literal social media vibes. Like that'll carry

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:51.520
 an early round or two. But then it's like what we don't need anything else right now. Like we

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:55.760
 don't need outside investment. We don't need other people. We literally have everything we need to

00:27:55.760 --> 00:28:00.480
 like go do this thing. And it's so fun. Yeah, I know. That's a funny part. Like it's, it's uh,

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:05.360
 it's uh, I mean, the the clear thing is, I think people mix this up and I think

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:11.040
 weirdly VCs are actually even pretty bad about this themselves. Like the trade-off we're making is

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:15.200
 there's a ceiling to this type of thing. Like this is never going to be a world-changing

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:20.640
 multi-billion dollar business. But by choosing not to do something like that, then it's a kind

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:25.280
 of very straightforward. Like you can grow, you know, just through selling more, selling more,

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:30.480
 selling more, et cetera. But like oftentimes I see VCs invest in businesses like this.

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:35.120
 And I'm like, I don't get it. Like you're supposed to be investing in things that are like crazy

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:39.280
 bets. They're not making any kind of crazy bet, really. No, right. We're making a slight bet,

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:44.880
 which is, you know, the developer audience is big enough that they can, yeah, they'll want to buy

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:49.760
 stuff consistently. But it's not like a massive bet. We're not trying to create anything totally new.

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:54.000
 Yeah. Yeah. I think a bunch of VCs would invest in this and I would be like, you're dumb. Like,

00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 why would you? I was telling you the other day, I was like, because you were like, I bet we could

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:07.920
 raise off of this. And I was like, huh, that's weird because I wouldn't invest in this. Yeah. Well, you're smart, but you're right. We probably could. And as we say, it's like, you're smart.

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:29.920
 These are not. Yeah. I literally just was trying to have the thought exercise. Like what would we do with capital? And I couldn't come up with anything. I mean, in my mind, it's like, oh, there's probably some stuff we could just make easier, but it's just like not. Yeah, I don't know if David, David probably doesn't listen to our podcast. I feel like if we could make David full time, like design is like everywhere. It's like, we literally need it everywhere. And

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:44.720
 I feel like he could just be slinging stuff all day long. It's like the first thing my mind went to. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, I'm getting way too specific here. I forget it's a podcast sometimes. I probably said that like a hundred times.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:58.080
 Remember that age Hacker News comment? So in one of the replies, and a person that posted is probably going to hear this, but we found it really funny, mostly because I misread it first. In the Hacker News post, someone was like, Oh, the two, two of the people working on this have

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 a podcast in parentheses, if conversational and off topic sometimes about tech. And I was like, well, first I read controversial. Yeah. And I was like, Whoa, we're controversial. We're so edgy. Yeah. I was like, but then I was like, wait a minute. I'm sure we're slightly controversial. But then I started thinking, are we like, do we like convey some kind of like weird political vibe that are people are picking? I went really deep on this and like from, I think five minutes before I realized

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:35.240
 conversational conversation. Oh, yeah. I feel like there's like some people that have voiced wanting to hear

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:49.960
 like the genesis of all this, like some of the backstory or even how we're building it. Like, there's a lot of like, how would you even do this? And I guess I didn't realize this wasn't super common knowledge. Do you want to talk about like how we built it, like the tech?

00:30:50.520 --> 00:31:18.400
 I think the genesis part is hard for us to just talk about. Oh, like the literal terminal part. Yeah, like just the underlying stack. We're going to open source at all at some point. So it's not like, yeah, yeah. I'm actually really excited. I'm really excited open source, because I think it's really interesting. Because on one hand, it is a terminal app, which is old school, but there's some like in an auto way. It's like a very modern app in terms of how it's built. It wasn't a lot of work to do the terminal thing. Yeah, right. Because we didn't

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:35.080
 build any of the stage stuff. Yeah, basically this whole business. And we call it a startup. We just wrap charm. Charm is great, by the way. Love charm. Yeah. So we came across this library in Go called charm, which I sorry, it's a company called charm. They make a series of libraries. I knew about them for a while.

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:47.880
 They make this thing called bubble tea, which is a way to do like really like crazy terminal UI stuff. And they like kind of handle, they have a little components that are for like more complex things, like inputs and things like that.

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:58.120
 And they help me, they really push the bar and what you can do in a terminal. And I came across them because we're using them for SSC. And like, we're very interested in that type of thing. Yeah. And like, then shout out bash bunny. I mean, the streamer circle.

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:18.280
 Yeah. Yeah. So we've like known about this for a while, but I didn't. And maybe I saw as when I forgot, but then we came across their other library called wish, where you can take any bubble tea thing, which is usually a CLI you run. That's the target. But you can just mount that same UI over SSH. And we realized, Oh, people don't have to install anything.

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:23.600
 Which is awesome. Like the idea that you don't have to install any CLI to get this experience. Like, that's really cool.

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:31.600
 And that was it. Like it pretty much handled everything. There's there's a lot of little quirks, like just so many little weird things to reconsider because

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:39.120
 anything from just like the terminal, not having different tech sizes, like you just need to think about you. I completely differently. Just like the color stuff that you've been

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:45.800
 like wrestling the past couple of days. It's funny. So you so the issue was in light mode, stuff looked off.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:55.200
 Someone reported an issue to me today for SST about how our colors look off in light mode. Yeah. I'm like, Oh, I know. You know what? I know why now. Yeah.

00:32:55.200 --> 00:33:04.200
 So there. So that's like the SSH part. But then the stage app, you can think of it like a front end. Like it doesn't actually do any of the business logic.

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:14.680
 It just talks to an API. And the API is like a totally different angle. It's like on Cloudflare workers. It's like using all the experimental stuff. So it's a mix of

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:27.840
 Cloudflare for the API. And then eight of us for gate ECS for the SSH app. And we've been able to use as the ion for this because we can deploy across multiple different providers.

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:42.040
 And it's been particularly useful because yes, we're using Cloudflare for the API, but we also need to guard the SSH server from DDoS attacks, which is like, Oh, we saw one pretty early, right? Like, yeah, well, that was a API.

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:52.720
 But I mean, I think it's because our domain, like we didn't create our domain, like we bought it from someone. Yeah. Like the moment I hit the training up, just like getting hit with like a bunch of random stuff.

00:33:52.720 --> 00:34:01.520
 Yeah. In using SST being able to configure like, Oh, like, uh, Cloudflare is a product called Spectrum, like put it in front of the SSH stuff, sort of thing proxies through.

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:08.960
 Yeah, it's like a mix of all these different things coming together. And it works really well. It does.

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:26.240
 It works great. I started thinking about like, I need to better understand the mechanic. Like if I, I need to sit down and like diagram exactly, exactly the infrastructure here because I realize in reading people's critiques of all this stuff, like it's just some, it's the mix of old and new tech that like.

00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:36.640
 I didn't really fully understand that like the Go applications actually running on our fargate instances and the SSH session just like proxies, the input output, basically, right?

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:51.240
 Yeah. So it's kind of a mind bender when you're used to just like a traditional web application, like a normal web architecture, like thinking about this app and like where everything's running and maybe it wasn't hard for you, but it's like keeps breaking my brain a little bit.

00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:59.080
 Yeah. It's confusing because I think the model is we're used to having a browser that like download stuff and run stuff off of our machine.

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:18.000
 But this is more like someone showing you a video feed of a browser in the cloud. Yeah. It's like, it's like an old like mainframe where there's like terminals connect. I mean, it's exactly that, right? Like where the thing is running on the other thing and it's just literally sending you the display and the input output.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:33.760
 It's like there's another parallel that escaped me just now. Oh, it's like when Google did that Stadia thing, like it's kind of like that model. It's like we're running the GPUs in the cloud, but then like just sending you everything so that you can interact with it.

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:48.120
 Yeah. And there was even that mighty browser thing for a little bit. Oh, yeah. So that's actually a really crazy story. So it was one of those things that Hacker News hated. So the idea was it's a browser that's actually running entirely in the cloud and the client

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:57.080
 application is just like, you know, a shell. It's like a video feed. So they put all this work into like using all this like crazy compression and lowering the latency.

00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:04.720
 And people were like, this is a really good product. Like I can have like a million tabs open, even on my like slow computer and like it worked great and solve the real problem.

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:15.280
 But then the M chips came out and that was actually what killed them and it made it so people's computers were fast enough again. Yep.

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:24.840
 And they like abandoned the thing and now they pivot it to another pretty cool product. Actually, it's like, it's like they're rethinking what Photoshop would be like if

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:30.440
 Oh, really? AI first. The people that made mighty the browser. That's what they're doing. Yeah.

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:40.640
 It's Sue or Sue, what's it say? I was, I was talking about him on here before, but he's a mixed panel founder, right? Oh, right, right, mixed panel. Yeah.

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:52.320
 Too high. So how do she? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, it's weird that like they got killed by by computers being never bet that that would. Yeah, it's like they just got faster in the fixy issue. Interesting.

00:36:52.320 --> 00:37:02.920
 I've never I've never once felt like I had too many tabs open, but I've always used like very powerful machines, I guess I never have more than a couple. I don't like constantly killing.

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:12.640
 I just thought Theo say that on Twitter, you just kill him, huh? You just don't like, well, the thing he was quote tweeting was like someone being like, I lost a thousand tabs and I'm like, what the hell?

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:19.920
 Like, there's no way you could actually keep track of a thousand tabs. But I do have this like sense of dread when I close it. Like, I'm going to need that one later.

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:26.280
 Like, I'm going to need it. It's like cables in a bin. It's like, I'm going to need it someday. I'm going to be like, where did that go? That's really crazy.

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:32.880
 Got rid of it. Because I totally get the cable thing. So I can relate to exactly that feeling. For some reason, it does not show up for me with a tab.

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:37.720
 For me, the frustration of trying to find the tab I'm looking for, like, dominates everything.

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:41.680
 I think in a lot of ways, the reminders for me, like every time I see the tab, I'm like, oh, yeah, I need to do that.

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:48.800
 I see the source of anxiety. Yeah, it is a source of anxiety. It's so it's going to be addicted to it. Yeah, I don't know. Also addicted.

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:52.120
 How much coffee have you drank? Because you're not really a coffee drinker.

00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:59.400
 I wasn't a coffee drinker for a couple of years. And then we started a coffee company and I'm back on coffee. I've got the whole setup, just like yours.

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:07.800
 It's like, you got that. So you got the old fellow stuff. Yeah, I got the the water kettle thing. I got the pour over that. Yeah, all of it.

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:16.000
 I've just been having like, I always just have like one large coffee in the morning, like a 20 ounce, you know what I mean?

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:22.120
 Like the whole deal, the full pitcher. So I have one of those every morning and I've been having decaf after that.

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:29.120
 I was asking Lizzie yesterday. I was like, I was like, what other products do you want to have like wholesale access to?

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:36.080
 Because now we can just get coffee at probably like half the price that we normally pay for. I mean, that's pretty useful.

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:43.200
 And I was like, man, we should get into like the paper towel game or something. Because I would love to sell price to the paper towels.

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:50.840
 Bellipper themed paper towels. It could be a thing. We'll see what the paper. Well, there's some jokes there for sure.

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:57.960
 That's another little thing that I like about like one. This is like such a simple concept, but when it clicked for me, it was like, I just found so interesting.

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:05.600
 Like, you know, sometimes when companies mess up, they'll give you like, they don't give you money back that they're not like, here's $25.

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:13.080
 We messed up. They're like, here's something a coupon that you can claim $25 a product. Yeah. Yeah.

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:20.160
 That makes total sense because $25 a product to the customer is like only like, you know, $12 a product for that.

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:25.120
 So they're actually like, they're like, they can kind of get away from me. That's made up. Yeah. I love that concept.

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:29.920
 And it's like, it's so simple and maybe like, not that interesting, but for me, I just found like, it's like so counterintuitive.

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:37.520
 Like, it feels like you're getting $25, but they're actually only giving you $12. Yeah, there's been a lot of a lot of little like brain tickling moments with this business.

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:51.600
 When you're used to just doing like software stuff, the physical world stuff just introduces all kinds of, or just like e-commerce, I guess, this problem space has all these different like interesting ideas that you just really, oh, you can just do that.

00:39:51.880 --> 00:40:04.320
 Like, the example I think of is the boxes that we shipped them in cost like a dollar, like a little over a dollar for each box and it's like, we just add it to the shipping costs, like shipping and handling.

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:11.360
 That's what handling is like, oh, we could just do that. We just like, add a dollar. I mean, like, you're paying for the box. It's amazing.

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:18.920
 I don't know if I wasn't supposed to say that. Was that like secret? No, no, it's fine. It's funny because, yeah, that's another thing I was looking at.

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:24.600
 I was like, everyone's mental model is there's a price of the product and there's the price of shipping.

00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:30.720
 And like everyone knows that there's these two components and they mostly evaluate what the price of product is worth it.

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:37.520
 And then the shipping, maybe sometimes it's a lot, but for the most part, they're like, okay, I live here and it costs money to get here.

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:48.520
 So whatever, they don't think too hard about that side. Yeah, but nothing is stopping you from distributing like $3 from the price of the product to the shipping bucket, you know, like, and like, I'm sure companies do that all the time.

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:55.120
 Yeah, exactly. It's like, it's just one price and they split it into ways where maybe it seems more amenable to you.

00:40:55.120 --> 00:41:06.120
 I think Uber eats does this a lot. And I have like no clear confirmation of this, but they basically give out five hours off, five hours off, like left and right there.

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:17.520
 There's like so many ways to get $5 off. But I noticed that when you use a $5 off thing, weirdly one of those variable prices, like the base price is like,

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:22.440
 $4 higher than I normally expect and they subtract five dollars off of that.

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:32.720
 That's dirty. Is that dirty? That's definitely dirty. That's definitely dirty. But like, I'm like, I'm pretty sure they just inflate the price whenever you use a coupon so they can break that down to it.

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:40.840
 Oh, I wouldn't put it past them, for sure. It's just like little things like that to show up. Yeah. Yeah, it's fun. I don't know. It's fun to do something different.

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:46.920
 If you've only ever done software development, I encourage you, start a little side hustle where you sell something, physical thing.

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:55.120
 It's also funny how mistakes cascade in ways that they don't and software because everything's virtual and you can like kind of undo things without any cost.

00:41:55.120 --> 00:42:09.120
 Yeah, like custom tape or a lack of a lack of boxes or shipping paper. Well, yeah, it's like, we had this weird cascading issue where initially we bought two size boxes, but then one of the box sizes was too small.

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:17.640
 So we started to ship everything in the bigger box. But that means we need a lot more packing paper because we're just putting one bag of coffee in a bigger box.

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:27.320
 So we ran out of packing papers. That means that the order more packing paper. And then that was like kind of slow to deliver, which means we can't pack anything else until the packing paper shows up.

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:38.800
 And then like, even the reason the box is too small, it's like, we thought about, OK, let's make sure the coffee fits, but we didn't think about, OK, does it receipt fix, but fit, but then it turns out that we never intended for the receipt to go.

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:43.320
 In the box, because that was just for the in-person orders, but the receipt looks really good in the box.

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:54.280
 Actually, we have 500 of them. We've got to do something with them. So yeah, the ripple effects are interesting. By the way, there's more paper and boxes coming today.

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:59.360
 Now we have an overload of paper too. Oh, no, too much paper.

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:06.920
 Yeah, because I ordered, I found like another place and they like got some stuff to us overnight because the other issue is me and lizard.

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:11.000
 Oh, yeah, you're going as graduating. Yeah, leaving Friday night. So it's everything done today.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:17.960
 So all the boxes are going out today for the nil orders. Yeah. So we shipped half so far. I think we have another 100 we need to do today. Yeah.

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:26.120
 And then we'll do it. And then the nil blend run is over. We over and we'll never have it again. Yeah.

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:32.920
 If you ordered nil blend, congratulations. You will be one of the few that ever owns that blend. We're retiring it.

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:40.800
 It was our kick off and new things, bigger, better things coming, maybe not better, bigger, no better, always better. Yeah, better.

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:47.480
 But I want people that bought nil to feel good about it. Like it's a good blend. It's a good bean, a good roast, you know.

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:56.520
 The other thing that I love seeing and this is a new experience for me was when we said sold out, there was a bunch of messages with people being like, no, I missed it.

00:43:56.520 --> 00:44:05.200
 Like, uh, and they're like upset. Yeah. And software never sells out. That's like software never sells out. That's like a new experience.

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:10.800
 You can just like run out of things if you're selling physical things. Yeah, that's a good tweet. I'm going to tweet from the S T account.

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:17.520
 Oh, yeah. We're sold out of S T. Yeah. Create some hype.

00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:31.520
 That was cool. Also seeing all the addresses and like seeing like, oh, like, it's so tangible. Like, yeah, these are all the places that people are going to really, you see the impact you're having on someone's life, like, they're going to receive this box.

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:38.520
 And then they're going to consume the thing in that box into their bodies. That's interesting. I hadn't actually put that together.

00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:45.520
 Like, we're selling a thing that people will literally in their bodies. Yeah. It's kind of wild.

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:55.520
 And you know, prime is licked every being. People will still ingest it. People will believe that he didn't really. He didn't. He didn't. He liked every being every single one.

00:44:55.520 --> 00:45:03.520
 I want to be clear here that he didn't. A legal is letting me know that we need to. But he did.

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:13.520
 It is fun to be doing this with priming teach. It's funny, like a little bit of the origin story. Can you remember how this all started? I think I was the last to come in.

00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:20.520
 Like the last to be looped into this. So could you tell like the origin story? I've never heard it. Why are we doing this? How did it start?

00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:27.520
 The coffee thing of the company terminal. I might have just forgot. Maybe I was involved early and I just don't remember. It's so fuzzy, right?

00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:35.520
 Yeah, I guess it always is like that. We had this little moment and it's like looking back is like, wait, how did all this come down? Like, we've obviously been working for a bit.

00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:46.520
 I do remember the details. I think I remember the exact exact beginning. So okay, prime tweeted a long time ago, like, Hey, I'd love for a coffee company. This sponsored me or something like that.

00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:57.520
 And I messaged him because I knew two people that had coffee roasters. And the one we're working with now. Initially, I approached them because they sell the coffee already.

00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:11.520
 So I just like, Oh, do you guys want to do like a partnership with prime? Yeah. And they didn't like it. It didn't really click for them. So they were like, Oh, can we do some kind of like rev share thing, which, you know, it just like wasn't interesting to him.

00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:26.520
 Yeah, then he talked to me about like actually like making, you know, his own brand. And I was like, Oh, yeah, we can definitely do that. And then that's when we looped everyone in, like you and TJ. And we started progressing.

00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:33.520
 And then commentary reached out to prime being like, Hey, like, let's do it. And prime loves commentary.

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:48.520
 And he was like, Okay, sorry guys. And then when I like go with this offer because it's right there. That happened twice. Right. Did it happen twice? I do. Maybe am I remembering wrong that he, he's, he was like, Okay, sorry guys, it was like the day after we all kind of like, we're like, let's do this.

00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:55.520
 He's like, Sorry guys, comment here approach. I'm going to do that. And then it was like, did it kind of revive again and then die again. I feel like it happened twice.

00:46:55.520 --> 00:47:05.520
 I think there was two, there were two things. I think commentary was the second one. I remember what the first, there was something else. But yeah, then he came back two months later being like, Okay, this commentary deal sucks.

00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:21.520
 Like something almost like 40 cents per sale or something. Like basically not worth it. So yeah, I know he really liked commentary. I think commentary. Everyone loves it. Right. I don't even know what it is. Is it like some kind of like normal coffee, but no, I think it's like some other thing.

00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:31.520
 Some other thing. I think they're like chemists or something, right? Like, yeah, it's like, it's like, they invented some way to like deliver coffee. Yeah. It's like these pods like some coffee that's.

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:40.520
 I don't know. Okay. So that, I mean, it looks like they have like people like Seth Rogen, like, but I get why they didn't get prime, you know, the Seth Rogen deal.

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:47.520
 Yeah. So then, but then he came back to us and then we're like, Okay, let's, okay, then let's do it for real. And then I think, I think that was, that was really it.

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:52.520
 But we just kept coming more and more ideas of like things to sell and ways to do it. So I did not like kept the money going.

00:47:52.520 --> 00:48:00.520
 So many people just think, I guess there was some trend with like influencers creating coffee brands where they just can click a button and they have a coffee brand.

00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:10.520
 And so many people think that's what's happening here. Like we just, we just like put our label on some SaaS service that's shipping coffee. That's not what we did.

00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:19.520
 And I know we said that online. But in our replies, there was a CEO of one of the companies that does that. I give it. It was called driply drip. Oh, really? Something.

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:29.520
 And he was just kind of like talking about some of his business. But yeah, they just like is definitely a way more involved process than something that was set up for like influencers like resale stuff.

00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:40.520
 We're so like partnering with companies, of course, we're not like, we're not basically roasting the beans, but we know who are also not growing them. Yeah, I'm glad we're going to be able to work with my friend too. He's a.

00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:48.520
 Yeah, I'm very excited about this. Yeah, there's so many little details I want to like catch up on. But I also, I don't know. I don't know if they're good content.

00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:53.520
 I don't know. Is this podcast good content? I don't know. People listen to us, then they're probably going to listen to whatever we say.

00:48:53.520 --> 00:49:03.520
 That's pretty like fun to think about. We can literally just talk about whatever we want. It doesn't matter. We can make whoever is this thing right now. We can make you listen to anything we say.

00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:19.520
 So we're going to say some things. I have a couple questions about logistics here. Did you find out? Yeah. Are we providing labels? Or are they taking address? Like, do you know that connection to them? How we're going to hand off? Is like a daily manifest kind of thing?

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:26.520
 No, well, we'll integrate like automatically with whatever workflow they have. So they use ship station for shipping. Oh, they do.

00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:37.520
 So we can just literally hit their ship station and do our or, okay, or we can, we can use our own and continue to provide labels. Like, we'll figure out the exact process, but they can do either.

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:48.520
 Yeah. Does that answer your question? No, it does. Yeah. And I mean, there's like more nuance, I guess, like in terms of what we have to deliver to them and how that's structured because.

00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:58.520
 Like, obviously, we're going to have some blends, some different options that people can buy, but then with each blend, it's going to be like, do you want whole bean? Do you want course or fine ground, like a few different grind options?

00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:04.520
 Wait, we're not grinding, though. Well, they are. The roaster does, right? No, no. So, but maybe they can't provide. We don't tell you.

00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:16.520
 Well, so he said they can, but he was like, it's a really messy process and like the quality deteriorates extremely fast. You can do it if you want to, but he doesn't recommend that we do it.

00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:22.520
 Really? Because I mean, they sell ground. He doesn't love doing it, but he just doesn't love doing it. He doesn't love doing it.

00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:29.520
 Yeah. But like some people won't buy coffee because they don't have a grinder and they don't want to learn or buy one.

00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:42.520
 But I was talking to Lizzie the other day and we have, so most people that start a coffee thing, they are like, oh, we're going to make like high quality coffee that appeals to people that are really into coffee.

00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:52.520
 That's different from us. We aren't trying to appeal to people that are really into coffee. We're actually taking an existing audience and trying to get them into this new thing if they're not already into it.

00:50:52.520 --> 00:51:02.520
 Yeah. So they're like, oh, it's like a thing that people discovered. Like the way you discovered BJJ, like people might discover they're actually really into this thing that they hadn't discovered before.

00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:12.520
 So our approach would actually be more to like curate everything they need to get into this. Educate them on how to prepare good coffee, basically.

00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:18.520
 Yeah. Because I agree, I would only want to buy whole beans. Like I don't want to buy pre-ground because it just loses the freshness or whatever.

00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:32.520
 Yeah. So selling them the grinder, selling them the filter, all those things. So Lizzie's sister works in any commerce at this pre-successful company.

00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:38.520
 And she told us all these pretty useful things. She talked to, she immediately was like, you guys should just sell reasonable straws.

00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:44.520
 And she's like these random one-off accessories end up doing really, really well.

00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:54.520
 Yeah. So that's kind of how I think about it more. Like if people, I'd rather like have like experience and like get people to buy into it than like cater to.

00:51:54.520 --> 00:52:04.520
 Yeah. But going to your point, yes. So there's like details about the order that it seems like I was looking, all there's also looking into like the, because you were trying to get that printed on the label automatically.

00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:08.520
 Mm-hmm. And it does seem like we should be able to do it because of what I also discovered.

00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:14.520
 It's our provider. I think, I think there is an option. I think I found it yesterday. They call it something that was unintuitive.

00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:18.520
 But I think if we just use their ship station, I know that ship station supports it.

00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:24.520
 Okay. We can just switch. Yeah. Okay. And I think then the label will have everything they need to fulfill it, right?

00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:31.520
 Yeah. So that's the only touch point. Like we literally just send labels to their thing and it would just, they just go off the label and ship the box.

00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:39.520
 Nice. I mean, that's nice if we just did that way. And obviously we need to make sure, and like they offer like a wide range of things.

00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:48.520
 Like they can like own a lot of it, like inventory manager, like all that stuff. I don't think we'll use them to that degree, but he gave us examples of how they're working with some other businesses.

00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:54.520
 Yeah. Like how we can kind of grow into something more like we don't have to just do the on demand. It's like serverless.

00:52:54.520 --> 00:53:02.520
 It's like we're starting out server right now. We can grow into like some EC2 instances. We need to bags that we roast for just us.

00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:12.520
 Yeah. It's exactly the same thing. Yeah. It's pretty cool. The parallels. Yeah. So that's, and we have to like ship them the bags and the boxes and yeah, and all that.

00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:17.520
 Yeah, I need to get that address and just update all these places. I've been shipping everything to your house now.

00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:23.520
 I don't think we're going to probably like keep doing the Amazon for like boxes and shipping materials. We got to find good suppliers for that stuff.

00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:30.520
 Yeah. He's got some recommendations too. But yeah, the like the labels. I'm very excited to see the packaging for our new roasts.

00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:39.520
 There'll be like, we just, when you have a good designer, it's just like every part of this is fun because like every around every corner, there's like new things to look at and they're just so cool.

00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:46.520
 They're going to be like collector's items. These bags, like they're all going to kind of like fit together and like belong to the same family, but they're going to be all unique in their own way.

00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:52.520
 I'm very excited. I'm a sucker for branding. Yeah. We got to make sure we save an archive on our end.

00:53:52.520 --> 00:54:09.520
 Oh, yeah. Like a one of each. Yeah. Like we have a version of each. Yeah. Good call. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, I'm so manic right now. I'm trying to really like hold back because I'm just sleeping very little. I'm drinking coffee.

00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:21.520
 I have a lot going on outside of this too. I mean, as you do, it's like there's so much to juggle right now. And it's a, it's that very exciting cycle of death where I'm too excited to sleep.

00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:29.520
 And I just fuel up on coffee. I get a ton of stuff done. And then I crash at night. And then I barely sleep. It's just a, it's a bad cycle.

00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:38.520
 I haven't sleeping normally. You don't drink coffee. I'm so jealous. I'm just flat. I'm just like this all the time. I'm just an addict.

00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:46.520
 I feel like most people are like you actually. I mean, not, I think you have like a extreme. You take it to an extreme, but most people are like because Liz is also very like up and down.

00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:54.520
 Like I haven't had my coffee. This is like every name in the world. It's like we're all addicted to this drug.

00:54:54.520 --> 00:55:03.520
 Well, yeah. So my heart also told us that coffee is the second most traded commodity after oil. Wow. That's so cool.

00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:15.520
 And we're like oil tycoons. Basically. The thought I had after was like, that's crazy. But then I was like, oh, I guess that's just what happens when you have like a drink.

00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:23.520
 You have like a drug that's legal. It literally is a drug that's legal. And then like it just embeds in every part of the world. Yeah.

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:33.520
 You know, it's funny though. Like I had this thought on the walk I took yesterday, which is like, are we drug dealers? No, I thought like no, it's like socially accepted.

00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:39.520
 So drugs, there's like a connotation with drugs that like you're doing a thing that's like against societal norms.

00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:46.520
 So even though it basically is a drug from like a physical standpoint, like you get addicted to it, it has crazy psychological effects.

00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:55.520
 Even though that's all true, because it's like everyone I know and love consumes it, it's different. It's not heroin. You know what I mean? Like it's different when it's socially acceptable.

00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:59.520
 Well, I have a different perspective on it. You think it's not different? We're all the statics. Sorry.

00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:04.520
 Because I don't drink coffee. I of course want to take the position that you're all drug addicts. We are.

00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:11.520
 I mean, I'm not because I'm better than all of you. Do you think there's anything to what I'm saying? Like that there is a difference?

00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:17.520
 Yeah, there clearly is a difference. Like, I mean, the difference ultimately is arbitrary. Like on hand, it's like social.

00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:24.520
 Okay, with some things. But on the other hand, like it does make a difference. Yeah, it's a soft difference, but it's a it's a difference nonetheless.

00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:31.520
 But like what is this question initially? Like are we drug dealers? Is that like a question? I mean, people said that like online. I mean, it's like a natural reaction.

00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:36.520
 Like, Oh, you're selling coffee. You're a drug dealer. There's been a lot of serious thing or is that a joke?

00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:43.520
 No, like no, it's like a joke. And then like I said, I was, I was getting high on my own supply drink in this coffee and people are like scar face memes and stuff.

00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:48.520
 Like it's like, yeah, but don't you want to be a drug? It's like you're looking for reasons to make us not drug dealers.

00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:51.520
 Oh, no, I'm all about it. I'm like, it's all like I want to be.

00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:57.520
 No, we're wholesome drug dealers. I posted that, that pushed it to the limit video before we went online.

00:56:57.520 --> 00:57:08.520
 Exactly. There is something about like, you've talked about the Kamado Joe thing. There's something it's scratching for me, which is like, I've gotten this in the software side too, but it's different.

00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:20.520
 It's like this feeling of like literally our whole goal is just to like delight people. It's like five people channeling all their energy towards like just like sparking a little joy in people's day. You know what I mean?

00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:32.520
 Like something about like they're going to make this coffee and enjoy it and like the memes that we're bringing into it. It's like we're mold it or melding like tech mean culture with this daily habit that's so enjoyable.

00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:37.520
 Something about that. You feel like Santa Claus a little bit like I'm just like making people happy and it's nice.

00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:49.520
 Yeah, I definitely feel that, but I think I miss out on a portion of it that the rest of you feel because I know like the ritual of making coffee every day is like a very like deep thing for people.

00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:57.520
 And I got the smells, the feels, like all of that. I think you're missing that part. You can just like watch Liz doesn't do it for me.

00:57:57.520 --> 00:58:07.520
 It's so interesting that Liz drinks coffee like that. I can't imagine like, I mean, Casey, she drinks decaf with me because I'm drinking coffee again, but it would be hard.

00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:14.520
 It'd be like one spouse having like a serious dietary restriction. The other not. I feel like one spouse not drinking coffee and the other drinking coffee.

00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:19.520
 It's such an interesting like, you're not tempted at all. You just like watch and you smell it now.

00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:23.520
 I think it smells great. I just do not have a taste. Just do not have a taste.

00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:28.520
 Objectively, you're on the right. You're in the right there. I feel like everyone adapts to it.

00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:35.520
 It tastes like dirt water. It really does. Like there's not a thing that people selling coffee should say a lab, but like it really is objectively terrible.

00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:42.520
 And then you get to where you love it and you're like, why do I like this? Why do I like the taste of this bitter hot drink that like scalds my mouth?

00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:48.520
 I don't know what I do and I just keep doing it. It's the caffeine. It's the addiction, whatever, drug.

00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:52.520
 That's amazing. It truly am better than everyone else.

00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:59.520
 You really are. Look at that self control. I really have to pee now. Again, coffee. It's like amplifying that urge a lot.

00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:08.520
 P and poop, I imagine. Yeah, we're not going to go into that, but someone's talking about that being a feature on the internet.

00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:13.520
