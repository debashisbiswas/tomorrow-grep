WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680
 So I don't tell me about these fights you're getting into so I'm not I'm not a big fighter. In

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.960
 fact, I hate conflict. I like I my personality is such that I can't stand if someone's upset

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.000
 with me, but I seem to I seem to be attracting it on Twitter. I think on Twitter, I think I'm just

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.720
 kind of like a jerk. I don't know, like in person, I'm much easier to get along with. I feel like

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.480
 on Twitter, the way I write, the way I type words, I think it just comes off abrasive and I just I

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.560
 yeah, I don't like it, but I'm definitely getting in more fights than normal. I think I've been kind

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.360
 of negative on Twitter too. Sorry, this is not answering the question you actually asked. I'm just

00:00:35.360 --> 00:01:04.320
 reflecting for the first time, I think. Yesterday, I got a fight yesterday. No, I wouldn't say it's a

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.360
 fight, but it's still kind of unresolved. Just conflict where I think we were just in two very

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.360
 different worlds talking about very different things, but somehow inflaming each other. I guess

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.560
 I could tell you what it's about. Do you want to know what the fight was about or what the conflict

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.800
 was about? Yeah, let's play back. What happened? Okay, so it's like 930 in the morning and I'm just

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.800
 mining my I'm just kidding. I don't know the timeline. I was just on Twitter and I was upset

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.880
 about the DHH thing, which we haven't talked about. I think we're just done talking about

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:47.920
 DHH things, but the latest thing to quickly recap, DHH 37 signals, basecamp guy, they'd like a thing

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.640
 for orchestrating containers on your own bare metal hardware. Anyway, I got really upset because

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.880
 I feel like he keeps saying these things and he's inviting startups and founders into this

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.840
 conversation that you should reconsider cloud and you should consider doing all this other work

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.800
 that you shouldn't ever consider doing if you're a startup. I just said something on Twitter about

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:16.640
 it because it upsets me every time I see anything that that man says. Someone that's a mutual follow

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.320
 of mine who I didn't really know how I knew him or there's a lot of that on Twitter, I guess.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.600
 You know, some maybe you don't really know how you know him. I think he maybe worked for AWS at

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:32.160
 one time, but I don't know what he does. I don't know his role, anything about him, and he sort of

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.080
 like took issue with something I said, quote, tweeted it. It ended up in like a place where it was like

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.480
 never listening to startup founders or idiots and like, quote, tweeting more of my stuff and

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.320
 everything he would reply to me, he would retweet himself. So it's just like a very public conversation

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:55.280
 and it tries to hit works for Dell. Like he works for Dell. He's like super into how data centers

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.920
 operate. And I don't care at all how data centers operate. I care about building very early stage

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:10.320
 software companies and talking with people who do that. And we were just not, we were not seeing

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.040
 AI. We're still not. I guess we're getting on the phone later today. So we'll see if it gets better.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:22.000
 But like, I think he thought everything I was saying sort of was attacking hardware vendors

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 when I don't care about hardware vendors in the least. I don't care about hardware. I don't want

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.880
 to know about hardware. I don't know anything about data centers or how they operate. But the

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:39.440
 things I was saying somehow sort of like drummed up in him, you're attacking my essence. Okay, I'm

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.920
 going to stop and give you a sec. I think that situation is a great example of something that

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:54.000
 happens over and over on the internet. The thing I am starting to say is I'm not actually looking

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.960
 for people to disagree with me anymore. I'm just kind of like looking for more people to agree with

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.200
 me. If I'm being completely honest, I know you're not supposed to say that. But I think the reality

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.880
 is, is there's kind of this assumption that, and because it sounds innately good, it sounds like,

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.320
 "Oh yeah, the internet should bring people from different bubbles and put them together so they

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.520
 can get better acquainted with each other's perspectives." And I think that can happen,

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:27.280
 and I think that does happen. But I think the majority of times, there's really no natural reason

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:34.320
 why certain two certain people should even come across each other. And I think the result is usually

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.200
 them getting upset with each other, thinking that one person is attacking another person,

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.120
 and one they really have no reason to come across paths. And I want to kind of retreats

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:50.320
 further into the way they think or like their tribe, whatever it is. So it's this weird thing where

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:58.880
 people try to solve this conflict by, I think, increasing the amount of, I don't know what to

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:06.000
 call intersections. But in a lot of ways, I think, historically, most of human history,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.240
 you, everything was hyper-local. You just interacted with the people physically around you.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.680
 And that maybe eliminated your view of the world in a negative way. So you definitely want a little

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.240
 more of that. But what we have today is definitely unnatural. And this is a funny situation because

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:27.120
 you're both in tech, and you would think that is one single group. But you're in a completely

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.800
 different subsection. And your experiences don't actually overlap at all. Not even a little.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:39.520
 Yeah. And it's funny, like, if you think about all of human history, like strong,

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.000
 local communities, where you depend on each other, all that, that's all broken down too. So we don't

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.600
 even have a lot of that. I think the more we go online, and the more connected we are,

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:55.360
 we're not only like now interacting with people that maybe we just shouldn't. Maybe we just

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:01.680
 don't have a reason to. But we're losing those strong bonds around us with people that kind of

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.280
 ground us. It's just a recipe for disaster. It's well documented, right? There's like a whole

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:13.600
 documentary about this, right? The Facebook thing. We're basically all headed toward

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.720
 destroying each other because we all hate each other more every day. Is that accurate?

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.960
 Yeah. And I think the medium itself is also interesting. I've had this experience so many times

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:31.360
 where, so as we can rewind, maybe like five or six years, my friends started this Slack group

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.160
 that was not just a bunch of my high school friends. And they invited just cool people that

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:42.000
 they knew through work or like other people kind of around the same age, kind of similar backgrounds,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.160
 like, you know, it's very New York focused. And it was a great community to be a part of.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:52.880
 But there were some like really epic crazy fights that went down in there that lasted like hours

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.520
 with like tons of people chiming in and people dunking on each other. And it would get pretty

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.880
 intense and it would kind of take up your whole day. And you just wouldn't stop thinking about it

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.680
 for days. And over time, like there were like these groups that formed that typically would

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.320
 fight each other. And you just had this crazy perception of these other people. But because

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.160
 we were all in New York, like we would go to the same parties together and things like that. And

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:19.840
 in person, it was so normal. And so like we all like loved each other. But then we'd forget like

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:25.440
 once we go quickly online, like we'd forget that. And then we'd have this other distorted view of

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:31.440
 people. And I think that experience, I think I learned how to operate a little bit. Like I remember

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:37.440
 when I first, I would kind of do everything. Oh, they really get sucked into a lot of this stuff. And

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:42.240
 and kind of repeat the same, the same cycles that were just kind of negative at the end of it.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:46.400
 I always regretted everything at the end. I was regretted engaging. I was regretted all of it.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:53.840
 But I think that kind of built up a little bit of awareness in myself around what is worth

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:58.320
 engaging with and what's not like there is there's always like a potential good side that can come

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:04.240
 out of engaging. But oftentimes it ends up being being worse. And if you did nothing.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.240
 Yeah. So what's the argument again? Like, I know there are a lot of people that say

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:13.520
 we need that outside influence, the other perspectives from people that aren't like us.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:18.720
 Is there just a right amount of dosage and we just get too much of it? Is that the problem?

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:24.000
 I think there's just certain parameters that need that people need to abide by for this to be

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:32.880
 productive. So for me, if I say something and the first reply to it is not a question,

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:39.680
 some of them might disagree. But typically, you usually want to get some clarification before you

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:48.080
 really sort of aggressively attacking them. If the first response is to immediately scale it up to

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:52.880
 this guy's an idiot or even if you remove the name calling, if you just look at it as

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:59.200
 they're just coming out with a certain intensity. And honestly, tweeting as a first

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:04.640
 move is kind of like that because a quote tweet is just like, to your follower, say like,

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:10.080
 look at this dummy. It's usually the format of that. And I've done it myself. And I think we all do

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:16.480
 it. So if the first step is not that, I think it's worth engaging with. If it's that, I almost

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:22.160
 always take the approach of my interpretation of that as being the first move is they're not looking

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:29.120
 to sharpen their awareness or sharpen my awareness. They're kind of looking for the arguments that

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:34.480
 we're all addicted to. We are all addicted to arguing and it is addicting. We all feel bad after,

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:39.280
 but it is addicting in a moment. So I can see when that's the first move, I interpret that as,

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:46.000
 okay, they're looking to satisfy that addiction. And I get pleasure out of depriving that mode.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.240
 Oftentimes when someone replies to me in that way, I'll just reply being like, yes.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:56.240
 And I won't, I won't say anything else. And then I can just feel the frustration that they really

00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:01.360
 wanted to get me to play. You're not taking the high road necessarily. You're just like a

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:06.640
 sadist, like you're just enjoying their pain, but for arriving than they are doing.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:11.520
 No, no. Yeah. I, I try to take the high road by not responding at all, but sometimes people just

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:17.760
 keep, you know, trying to like, yeah, the other day I was talking about, I was like, I had those

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:23.280
 tweets where I was talking about how the front end world has adopted serverless in a much more

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:28.560
 intuitive way where they don't even think about anything else. And not even having these

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.400
 discussions around like bare metal, whatever. And I thought that was interesting because

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.240
 us in the back end world were like still having this conversation and the front end world like

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:42.000
 completely moved on. Yeah. And that offended a bunch of people who were, who identified as

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.280
 back end engineers. So a bunch of people were replying. I identify as a back end engineer. Go

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:54.080
 ahead. Yeah. And a bunch of people were like, look at this idiot front end engineer, like thinking

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:59.360
 bubble. And I'm like, I want to tell her things. I'm a front engineer. Well, you know more about

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:04.240
 front end to be fair than most front end engineers. So it's you kind of are a front engineer. You're

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:11.680
 just, you prefer to be a back end engineer or whatever you are. I mean, you can have a conversation with

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:17.760
 Ryan Cardiado about the depths of react and solid in ways that I don't think there are many

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:23.280
 front end developers that can do that. So the front end label, I think is aptly labeled or thrown

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:26.720
 on you. You know, it definitely makes sense why people perceive me that way because most of my

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:31.440
 conversations on Twitter are about the front end. But like my day to day work is so far from now.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:35.920
 Like I'm literally working on infrastructure. Yeah. So I offended a few people. And then

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:40.720
 someone was replying being trying to, they just kept trying to like get me to fight them. And

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:45.280
 they kept being like, they just kept implying that I was a front engineer and knew nothing about

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:50.080
 back end. So I was replied being like, I'm a back end engineer and then say anything else. And they

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:55.680
 replied again saying, well, if you're a back end engineer, that means you're saying that front end

00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:01.600
 people are smarter than you. And I was like, yes. And then they stopped. And I didn't feel bad. I

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:07.520
 felt good. Where if I'm sure if I got into like a debate with them, I would have felt bad. I think

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:12.720
 we would have both felt bad. So I think I kind of saved both of us in some ways. Yeah. Yeah. No,

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:19.440
 I was just reminding me of an episode where I felt really bad for two days after a pretty bad

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:24.080
 Twitter fight. And like, I just said a lot of things I shouldn't have said. And I regretted it.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:28.880
 And I had to apologize to a whole lot of people. I got phone calls about it. It was just a bad deal.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:35.040
 That's where the internet can lead you. And yeah, I don't know. Like, it's like the first thing I say,

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:40.080
 generally, if I tweet something reacting to something that happened, it's always pretty

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:44.880
 inflammatory. And I think that's just kind of like instinct that you know, that's kind of the stuff

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:50.720
 you say on Twitter. Like, is that the problem? Like, I feel like anyone reacting to me negatively

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:55.440
 is fully justified because I kind of said something I just shouldn't have said in the first place.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:01.040
 Even if like, we're on different pages, we shouldn't really be arguing right now. I kind of invited it.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:06.080
 Yeah, I think it's with all this stuff, it's kind of complicated, right? Like, if you take that to

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:11.920
 an extreme, you kind of eliminate all comedy in a way. Like, there is a level of, I think some of

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:21.120
 the things I say are probably snarky if you like, just honestly, they are. But they're also funny

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:27.920
 for the right audience. But for the wrong audience, they might get upset and they might reply to me

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:33.440
 in a way where they're annoyed. And you're right, they're 100% justified in venting in that way,

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:38.720
 because they, I annoyed them. Yeah. So I think it's okay. I think that I'm not going to say like,

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:42.720
 the world needs to get rid of that because there is comedy there. And what are we going to have

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:46.560
 otherwise? It's a bunch of like really bland statements and million qualifiers. And people

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:50.640
 talk about this a lot where like, there's like almost this Twitter speak that people get trained

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:55.840
 into where they qualify the heck out of everything they say, because they're anticipating all the

00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:01.920
 people interpreting them in some black and white way. Like, they'll say like, mostly or like,

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:07.440
 sometimes or usually or I know this, but I know that like it's you kind of fill it with all this

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:12.720
 filler stuff, which I get why people do that. But this is a defensive way of talking that I don't

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:18.960
 really love either. It's not very natural. Yeah. We all get it. It depends. We get it. Like,

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:23.200
 everything depends. But that's not fun. Like, that's not fun to talk on Twitter about how,

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:29.520
 like, this little thing is just an edge case where sometimes it's more fun to be like,

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:33.200
 you should always or this is the best because we're excited about things.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:38.560
 I don't know. Yeah, we're excited. And I think oftentimes when you need to make change

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:43.040
 or there's habits or biases, you do need to phrase things in that way so that

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:49.440
 it moves even like, you know, 5% in direction that it should. Like, if you say, if there's

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:53.600
 there's like a bad practice that's rampant and common and you say, you should never do this,

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:59.520
 that has a chance of reducing it by 5%. It's not like people are going to hear that and like,

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:04.480
 just 100% listen to you and no one's ever going to consider it again. So to me, that's kind of,

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:09.120
 yeah, it's like what you said, it's boring. It's like, why focus on that detail? Yeah, we're not

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:14.800
 dummies. We know that there's almost nothing that is always and almost something that's never.

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:20.080
 And we only have 240 characters, so. Well, actually you have a lot now. I think you can do as many

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:25.520
 as you want. Yeah, well, I don't know if there's an end. That's few shell out the money. Oh, it's

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:30.560
 not just fruit. Okay, yeah. I tell you, my wife got upset. Like, all the things I spend money on,

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:35.600
 my my wife was like, why are we spending $8 on Twitter? She saw it on like iTunes bill. I didn't

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:40.640
 think about it being like on our personal stuff. Like, well, it's hard to explain. But basically,

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:44.480
 you have to pay for Twitter now. It's, it's important. And she's like, I don't think you have to pay

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:51.200
 for Twitter. Did you buy all your followers? And like, kind of, but not with Twitter blue.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:56.080
 I literally, I've been paying for Twitter since what even this is even before the Elon

00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:00.960
 thing. Yeah, same. It's because I two dollars or whatever. Yeah, I spend so much time on this thing.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:06.880
 And I want to like help them in any way possible. I hate all the features I get with it. I literally

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:11.440
 pay for Twitter blue and I turn everything off the undo. I can't see I thought I turned it off,

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:15.360
 but I can't seem to keep it to stay off. Like on web, it'll keep showing up. I'm like, just send

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:19.600
 it now. Why would I want to wait for this tweet to go out? Like, there are things in life I regret.

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:23.920
 I don't regret that. Well, this whole this whole episode has been about how maybe you should wait.

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:32.160
 Oh, yeah. Think about it. Maybe that's a good feature. Read the tweet first. Are you inflamed?

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:36.800
 Like, can I like objectively look at it? Yeah. That's how I try to get into fake fight. Oh,

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:40.240
 so you're going to say something important. No, no, go ahead. Tell me about your fake fight.

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:44.720
 Yeah, I just remembered talking about Twitter fights. It was another situation where I said

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:49.440
 something like I quote tweeted somebody was rocks. I'm just going to say it because it's fun.

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:55.600
 I quote tweeted rocks. And I was sort of like, Oh, no, I subtweeted him. I didn't quote tweet

00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:00.480
 it. It was a word. It was a sub tweet. And he figured out it was about him. I subtweeted rocks.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:05.440
 He he DM me is like, Hey, you want to have a fake fight just to drum up some excitement.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:11.520
 That sounded fun. So we, but we're about too nice. So it failed miserably. Like we were trying to

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:15.520
 like find a way to escalate and neither one of us good. And so we banded it like an hour later.

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:19.520
 Yeah, you need the real emotion behind it. Yeah, there was a moment there were a couple people

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:23.200
 like don't that I remember saw one of the tweets and he's like, Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:27.360
 you guys were going back and forth. He thought we were really fighting. So we can convince somebody

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:32.960
 at least one person. Nice. The other thing I was thinking about is communities that do this pretty

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:42.320
 well. And I think it's this concept of they just have certain rules. And they accept that sometimes

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:47.120
 that means good conversation gets eliminated by those rules. But it's for the long term health of

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:52.800
 the community. As I know people hate on hacker news a lot. And they're just like, of course,

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:58.240
 all these funny things with hacker news that we can make fun of. But in terms of their comment

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:02.960
 section for how long they've been around, how much growth they've seen, how fast some of that growth

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:09.200
 has been. Their comment section is pretty good. Like it doesn't really turn that often into this

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:15.040
 kind of stuff we see on Twitter stuff that just is unhealthy. People stamp out very quickly.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:21.200
 Their moderator for us named dang, I think he's he's amazing. He's incredible. I think he's

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:26.000
 he's been doing this for doing that for so long. And he's made very few mistakes. And he just has

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.800
 a set of rules he follows. And the conversation there does tend to be pretty good. Like, I think

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:36.160
 people make fun of them because they're a bunch of nerds. We're a bunch of nerds. We're all a

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:42.160
 bunch of nerds and we have stupid ways of thinking sometimes. But in terms of the quality of the

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:47.360
 back and forth, I find it to be pretty healthy. People generally give people a benefit of the

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:52.800
 doubt. This thing of like someone saying something and then someone figuring out like the most

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:56.320
 black and white by interpretation of it and then arguing against that and then that like

00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:02.160
 devolving. I don't see that happen there that much. So yeah, I think this kind of thing can work.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:10.000
 And it does require certain rules people abiding by. And yeah, some days we're annoyed. So we fail,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.440
 we fall short of that. And that's okay. I basically think it's all okay. I know like people get into

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:20.800
 really intense stuff, but you learn over time, like what types of behavior leads to situations

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:25.600
 you regret and you know that it's not worth it. And you just learn that over time. And maybe some

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:31.120
 people never do, but I feel like most people will figure that out. Yeah, my mind's all over the place.

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:35.280
 But I just started thinking through like is Twitter, is it uniquely Twitter? Like do most

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:40.000
 fights that I'm involved in happen on Twitter? I think of like Reddit places where like people

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.600
 complain about the comments being so negative, but they don't really, there's not fights on those

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:51.760
 platforms, at least in my experience, is that? Are there other places other than Twitter? I

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:56.720
 guess Facebook probably, but I don't know anybody that gets on Facebook. I think on Twitter, it feels

00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:02.160
 a little bit more like a traditional fight because our identities are so visible. Like our parts

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:09.280
 zone as are on Twitter. Yeah, like your PhD, XR is reded and five was DAX and that cartoon avatar.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.400
 Or yeah, I just I'm now going through all of the people on Twitter that I can think of trash

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:22.480
 dev like all these real people and their identities. Yeah, I guess I didn't mean like they're real

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:26.960
 identity. I just meant like, I know what you mean. The concept of a person is so visible. Like

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:31.040
 you know, there's like a person. And so when these fights happen, it's between these people

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:36.160
 that you could recognize. There's reputations like tied to those identities, even if they're

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:42.480
 pseudo anonymous or whatever the word is. Yeah. So they feel a lot more like like beefs or fights.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:48.160
 I imagine all the platforms are probably similar. I just I've never really been like a Reddit

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:52.240
 commenter. So I don't really know what kinds of things happen there. I read a lot on Reddit.

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:58.240
 That's it. Yeah. I do get this thing when I talk to people in real life. Like I mentioned

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:03.760
 Twitter, we probably Twitter comes up. Oftentimes, there's like a groan of being like, oh, yeah, like

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:08.640
 I always like regret going on it. I have always negative experiences on it or it just makes me

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:14.960
 feel terrible. And I don't have that experience at all. Of course, it happens every once in a while,

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:21.200
 but majority of my Twitter experience is fantastic. It does take work, I think like I'm very specific

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:26.960
 about who I follow. I pay attention to who's quote tweeting stuff I don't want to see into my feed.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:33.360
 I think that's one of the biggest things. You know, there's my bubble that I'm a part of. And

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:37.680
 generally, people in my bubble think a certain way. And some people in my bubble will occasionally

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:42.160
 quote tweet something from outside my bubble being like, look how stupid this is. And then I'll waste

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:47.280
 10 minutes reading like hate reading all the replies. Yeah. And I think that's where all the

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:52.640
 negativity enters for me. And as long as I kind of unfollow people that do that too much. My experience

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:56.560
 is pretty good. I don't know about you. Yeah, I just I need to do better about that. I don't

00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:00.960
 unfollow people. I feel like I'm slapping someone if I unfollow them. Like it just feels like a hate

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:06.960
 crime. I don't know. So I just basically have never unfollowed people that just like follow

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:13.440
 list grows until the end of time. But I do mute people. If I see in usually though, it's not like

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:17.840
 this person said something that made me upset. It's usually just like this person kind of annoys

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:22.080
 me and I don't want to unfollow them. That's rude. But I'm going to go ahead and mute them so I never

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:26.240
 see their stuff. It's always funny when like those people are still kind of involved in the bubble.

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:31.520
 And you just see replies to tweet and it's like this person's muted. It's always fun to like tap

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:37.360
 that like, who did I mute? Oh, yeah. Yeah. And then I always I'm always like, Oh, that's why I

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:42.640
 needed them. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, reply to that tweet is like further evidence that they need to be

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:48.320
 muted. Yeah, it's a hard thing. I think Twitter is interesting because there you do have this little

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:54.800
 bubble that you exist in, but it's so touches so many other bubbles that there's no way to keep it

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:59.920
 all out for good. You have to actively have to stay on top of it. And I've heard other people say

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:04.160
 that. So I think you're just probably good at that and you get better. Yeah, I just get so much

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:09.440
 value from it that I it's like worth putting in the effort of making sure it works well. I do love

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:17.040
 Twitter. It just feels like the place where we hang out. And I hope it never dies. So filter bubbles

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:22.560
 are good. That's what you're you're telling us. Yeah, I think we should kind of embrace the fact that

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:27.760
 we want to be around people that are somewhat similar to us. And that doesn't mean there's not

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:32.960
 diversity within that group. There's all kinds of diversity in there, but you need like a shared

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:39.120
 context. And we can kind of we've all witnessed what happens when when you don't have that. All

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:44.000
 right, well, don't get any more internet fights. I think we've we've had enough fights this week,

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:55.360
 at least. Well, on to the next week. Yeah. All right, see you next. See you.
