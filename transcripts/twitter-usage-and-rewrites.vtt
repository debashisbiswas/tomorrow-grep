00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780
 - Why do 20,000 people follow you?

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.260
 - Let's talk about that.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.860
 Why do 20,000 people follow me?

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.520
 Why do 10,000 people follow you?

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.660
 Why am I twice as important as you on the internet?

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:11.500
 That's the question.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.960
 (laughing)

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.540
 (upbeat music)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.840
 - Did you have like a big period of growth?

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.080
 'Cause for me, it was like years of like pretty much

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.320
 like just, you know, 20% increases every month or whatever.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.440
 And that's slowly compounded.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.640
 And it grew a lot since January

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.800
 'cause I've been doing a lot more online,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.200
 but yeah, it wasn't like explosive growth.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.040
 I think it was like really slow growth.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.360
 - Yeah, mine was, I mean, I've had Twitter

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.040
 for like 15 years or whatever, 13 year, whatever it is,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.560
 since the beginning.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.600
 But I didn't really use it until like maybe a year

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.440
 and a half ago.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.600
 Like I didn't actually tweet.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.440
 I just read stuff.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.760
 - It's more than a year and a half ago

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.360
 because the first DM you sent me is gonna be on Saturday,

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.800
 the Saturday or this Friday, two years.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.640
 - Oh, wow.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.160
 - Our DM, our DM anniversary.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.000
 - Yeah.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.400
 (laughing)

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.680
 - Okay, so I was using it.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.240
 Okay, so yeah, whenever I would have had you

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.840
 on eight of this FM, I guess I was probably getting started

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.880
 being active on Twitter.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.720
 - Yeah.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.280
 - I would say like, I have 20,000 people to follow me

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.000
 because of like six tweets.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 So like, there was one tweet that took me from like 100 to 1000.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.960
 And then there was another tweet

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.360
 and it was like, I went to 3,000 off that one.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.440
 It's like, I never really grew outside of some big ones.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.400
 So all of my following follows me for a different reason.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.920
 They're in like five different categories

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.320
 and they hate everything I tweet

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.920
 and I wish I didn't have a following at all.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.360
 (laughing)

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.400
 - Maybe you just start over and have a tighter personality.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.800
 - I guess I could, a tighter personality.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.400
 I feel like I do have a tighter personality now, but--

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.240
 - Yeah, the baggage.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.600
 - I do, I think I have like, yeah, the baggage.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.760
 I just like, there's multiples of my following

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.920
 that I don't deserve.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.600
 I should be at like 1,000 and that would be good.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.800
 I'd be a healthy following.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.240
 - I've told you about my Twitter history, right?

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.360
 Like how I had to stop for a while and then restart it again?

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.360
 - No.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.400
 - Okay, so--

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.400
 - I'm addicted?

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.240
 Go ahead.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.160
 - No, it was actually, it's a kind of a fine situation.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.560
 So like years ago, I don't know how many years ago,

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.320
 maybe like 2017, I'll say.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.720
 That's kind of when I first started to really use it.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.320
 And I was using it every day and I was like,

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.600
 kind of in a certain bubble.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.000
 It actually wasn't tech Twitter.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.320
 It was like, I don't know, I don't know what it is.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.960
 It was adjacent to tech Twitter for sure.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.920
 I think it was like less on the engineering side

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.920
 and more on just tech in general or like startups, et cetera.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:49.920
 - Yeah.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.880
 - And I was like using it pretty frequently.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.440
 I got to a point where that guy,

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.520
 I think I mentioned this to you before, that guy,

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.840
 oh no, I did tell you this

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.400
 'cause I said that guy in the vault followed me

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.320
 and you kept saying navel.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.320
 - Oh yeah.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.160
 (laughing)

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.000
 - Navel.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.840
 - Navel.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.680
 - Yeah, so--

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.520
 - Like the orange.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.200
 - Yeah, or like the ocean forces, military navel.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.520
 - Oh, navel, yeah, yeah.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.320
 (laughing)

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.360
 - So he at one point retweeted something of mine

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.000
 when he has like crazy following.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.160
 So they got huge amount of lights

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.480
 out of huge amount of followers from that.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.160
 And I was like, oh, it was really cool.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.240
 And then something kept happening to the app on my phone

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.160
 where it would just stop working.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.120
 Like I would use it and it would just be super slow

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.160
 or like it just like wouldn't be loading at all.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.560
 And then if I uninstalled it and reinstalled it,

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.920
 it would work for like a day

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.280
 and then it would just stop working again.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.280
 And that friction just made it so I just stopped,

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.640
 I just started to stop using Twitter just overnight,

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.480
 basically 'cause it just--

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.080
 - Do you run like arch Linux on your phone?

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.080
 What's wrong with you?

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.920
 - No.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.000
 (laughing)

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.160
 - So I was just like, this is so annoying

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.560
 but I never prioritized fixing it.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.080
 So I just kind of slowly just like weaned off it.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.880
 And then at some point I realized there's some like

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.520
 super deep hidden setting in Android

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.280
 that lets you like turn off internet access

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.280
 for a specific app.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.680
 And I don't know how, but it kept getting turned on.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.800
 So I literally was off Twitter for a year and a half

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.080
 until I unflipped that and I figured out what was going on.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.640
 And then I started using it again.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.480
 - Wow.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.320
 - That's when you were using it again.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.760
 And that's how we met.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:19.600
 And then like I got more into--

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.400
 - Rest is history. - Yeah, exactly.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.600
 So if, yeah, if I ever need to like kick my Twitter addiction

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.920
 that's got to turn on that setting

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.640
 and just makes it so frustrating to use it.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.320
 Well, I have to have someone secretly turn it on

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.600
 so I don't know what's going on.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.480
 - I've never heard of that.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.520
 Yeah, I never had issues.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.840
 I just never, for years I would tweet like once

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.160
 every other year and I mean that was for 10 years.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.720
 It was like, I could never understand how people had

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.560
 like the idea to like, I'm gonna write this

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.080
 on like a public forum.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.040
 Like just sharing things about what's going on

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.440
 was just so foreign to me.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.080
 And I would look at people who had like thousands of tweets,

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.200
 not followers, like they had tweeted thousands of times

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.640
 and I just thought like, how in the world

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.400
 have they tweeted 5,000 times?

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.840
 And then it's like, that's just a tiny amount.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.720
 There's like people with 100,000 tweets.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.680
 And I just couldn't wrap my head around it.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.760
 And then eventually something clicked.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.520
 I don't know, I started actually engaging,

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.000
 tweeting with people, you know,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.640
 replying to people or whatever.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.760
 And yeah, now I'm hooked.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.040
 I'm pretty hooked.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.240
 So first time anything's ever clicked for me on social.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.920
 - Yeah, I think for me that first phase,

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.120
 it was really like, I always wanted to get better

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.640
 at writing and before the outlet for that was,

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.560
 oh, write a blog post, which I just never did.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.160
 It was just so much upfront work.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.880
 And like just a barrier to sitting down

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.720
 writing like a full blog post a lot.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.760
 But I still wanted to get better at writing.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.280
 And what I liked about Twitter was the character limit

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.920
 is like a nice little like training zone

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.080
 for like learning how to write well

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.440
 because you have to strip every unnecessary word.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.360
 You have to compress every complex thought

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.520
 into like the fewest characters possible

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.800
 while still like explaining it well.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.880
 And I think like doing that after like six months

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.000
 like every day trying to like express my thoughts in that way,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.200
 I feel like I became so much better

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.080
 at writing and expressing ideas.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.840
 It's kind of like, you suck at it for a while

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.160
 then all of a sudden it just flips and you're like,

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.480
 oh yeah, this is how you do it.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:10.480
 And you end up sounding more like really legit writers.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.480
 That's what they do.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.720
 They just like analyze every word

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.120
 and like drop the ones that are just fluff.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.640
 Kill your darlings, I think they say.

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:19.480
 Yeah.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.920
 Do you remember the 140 characters?

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.080
 I don't even remember it at this point.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.520
 I can't believe it was that short at one point.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.960
 I know, that's intense.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.120
 Yeah.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.200
 And now there's no limit.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.320
 Well, it's like, is it 4,000 or something?

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.400
 Something crazy.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.920
 I still impose artificial limits on myself.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.040
 I say that if I'm doing just a tweet on my own,

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.800
 I'm sticking to a 280 limit.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.640
 Yeah.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.600
 If I'm replying to someone, I'll go over

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.600
 'cause I'm like trying to like explain something in detail.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.280
 But, yeah, I've always liked that it forced you to compress.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.360
 I saw you say that on Twitter that you kind of have that look.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.640
 I think I intuitively did the same thing.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.720
 Like I wouldn't write like a first tweet that was like a big,

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.320
 I saw somebody their day post like a whole blog post

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.880
 on like a top tweet, like a top level tweet.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:02.840
 I thought that was interesting.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.160
 I don't know if that's going to be a thing.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.240
 I just never read them.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.680
 I had like formatting and everything.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.000
 Yeah, it's just, it's not the place I want to like sit down

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.160
 and read for seven minutes in a row.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.800
 It feels very LinkedIn.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.480
 If I whenever I see screenshots of LinkedIn,

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.320
 it's stuff like that.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.520
 Yeah, exactly.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.040
 But I do like in a reply when somebody has a tough question now,

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.240
 you're not stuck like chaining ripple.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.000
 You can just like write a big blob

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.360
 and it might be helpful to them.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.880
 I've seen you do that.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.080
 I like the idea that I could do it.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:30.920
 I haven't done it yet.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.320
 I mean, I'm not very helpful on the internet,

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.480
 but it's a possible now.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.240
 There's nothing restricting me.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.480
 Yeah, I was worried that people would use it too much

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.640
 and then my feed would just be these giant things.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.600
 But so far, no one's really using it too much.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.000
 So it hasn't been, hasn't been bad.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.480
 Yeah, I guess we're just talking about Twitter now.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.520
 I don't know how this happened, but did you see something?

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.760
 I don't know if Elon Musk tweeted it.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.080
 Somebody tweeted that something about amount of time spent

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:59.240
 looking at a tweet, like that's what drives

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.960
 how much it'll get spread or something.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:02.800
 Wait, really?

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.640
 I don't know.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.080
 Yeah, that's what somebody said.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.080
 Time spent.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:09.520
 Yeah, like how if you spend a lot of time looking at a tweet,

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.280
 then that tweet is getting like some kind of a boost

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.200
 from the algorithm.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.560
 So if I write a tweet where everything is spelled wrong

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.880
 and people are like trying to like,

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.160
 shortly gonna read it or like it's really confusing,

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.000
 that will go viral.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.280
 Maybe, maybe.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.160
 I do feel like there's something with misspellings

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.640
 that people have caught in the past.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.520
 I don't know if this is a new change

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:27.760
 and I don't know why I brought it up

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:28.680
 'cause I just don't care.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:29.520
 That is interesting.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.240
 But I brought it up 'cause we're talking about Twitter.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.880
 Okay, let's talk about something else.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.360
 Well, what are you doing technically?

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.800
 Like what are you working on engineering wise?

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.080
 What are you typing into your computer?

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.600
 It's a great question, Dax.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:46.080
 So right now my default project is statins.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.640
 We're doing a rewrite, as you know, in Astro.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.360
 And, oh, we gotta talk about CloudFront.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.240
 That's related to my statinies work.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.040
 That's my default project.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.280
 I want after vacation to get back on rebase,

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.640
 but that's what I wanna answer right now.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.920
 But I can't 'cause it's not true.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.280
 I'm not technically writing it into my computer right now,

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.000
 but it's top of mind.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.440
 We're working on some stuff.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.800
 We've got some music coming.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.560
 I also wanna say that I'm working on Laravel stuff right now,

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.400
 but I'm not.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.560
 You want to say.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.240
 I wanna say, you're not answering my question at all.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.200
 I asked what you were doing

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.680
 and you're just giving me your hopes and dreams.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:23.520
 (laughs)

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.360
 It really is.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.360
 If I'm being honest,

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.480
 I've been in a bit of a heavy non-technical phase here

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.600
 since we wrapped up the statinies.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.320
 We had a big push like doing a paywall on the Elixir app

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.480
 that is the existing statinies app.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.960
 That was, it was hard.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.080
 It was like the first time I've pushed hard in like five years.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.040
 (laughs)

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.160
 And by pushed hard, I just mean like,

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.080
 I mean, I still work the same hours mostly.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.960
 I just, I didn't take a lot of purpose.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:52.960
 - No, I know what this means.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.440
 It means it's just so funny.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.360
 It's so clear what you mean by pushed hard

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.360
 because what you were normally doing was spending

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.160
 half the day on Twitch talking to chat.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.000
 - Okay, okay.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.680
 - And then you just removed that part of it

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.360
 and you went back to being a normal person

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.520
 and relatively that's pushing hard these days.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:09.480
 - It was hard, okay?

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.480
 It was hard on me and my family.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.480
 - No, I get it.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.960
 I am in the same place, so.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:13.880
 (laughs)

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.200
 - Yeah.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:19.080
 So it's been like, it's been less, less of that.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:19.920
 - Yeah.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.360
 - More of this.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.200
 - Are you guys close?

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.920
 'Cause you guys are rewriting the whole site in Astro,

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.080
 which I'm really excited by

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.640
 'cause I think it's gonna be

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.880
 maybe the biggest traffic Astro site potentially

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:31.760
 that's gonna be out there.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.040
 'Cause Astro's still pretty new.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.040
 - Yeah.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.680
 - So you guys will be like a great,

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.520
 one, a great case study for them

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.440
 and then two, since it's being deployed through SST

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.880
 and a great one for us as well.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.920
 And it's like such a good use case.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:49.160
 Like it's for like a company that has like a ton of traffic

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.520
 with like real users using it, like it makes money,

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.800
 using a new tech and it's gonna be all serverless.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.560
 And now the Stelwell Revaldate thing came out,

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.400
 which is, I think you guys are gonna use that a lot, right?

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.400
 - Yeah, just hope it all works, you know?

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.400
 Just having this moment where I'm like,

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.760
 this is all gonna work, right?

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.600
 - A lot, that's.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.320
 - It's gonna have to get, yeah, it's like,

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.920
 it's not that SST's not gonna work.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.160
 It's just like, gotta make sure limits, you know?

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.640
 Like quotas are all in place to handle the kind of load

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:21.160
 for page, just normal pages to be hit.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.920
 'Cause I don't know, Lambda Invocation limits.

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.760
 There's a lot of different limits involved.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.000
 I don't think we're gonna have any problems.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.440
 I think we can get it all sorted out.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.960
 We're gonna have to like figure out a way

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.480
 to load test it and make sure.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.800
 But yeah, we do something like, I don't know,

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.640
 50 million uniques now a month.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.160
 We've grown like crazy every month for the last year.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.800
 It's definitely gonna be one of the bigger astrocytes.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.440
 I talked to Fred about it and he said,

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.880
 he wanted to do like a case study or something.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.440
 Like it's gonna be a big moment.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.280
 - Yeah.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.960
 - I'm excited, but yeah, we're close.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.400
 I'd say we're like 80% in terms of the UI,

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.920
 like stuff that needs to be there.

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.200
 And then so there's like 20% left on that,

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.880
 but then there's all the other stuff.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.480
 Like I said, load testing, we gotta be sure

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.560
 that this thing's not gonna fall over.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.800
 There's other like weird stuff like analytics

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.840
 and all these stupid things I have to port over

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.240
 that I forget about all the time.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.040
 But like the bulk of the app is written

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.540
 like the front end stuff.

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.400
 Yeah, we're getting close.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.560
 - Yeah, do you have an idea of how you're gonna roll it over?

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.360
 Like, you know, like slowly, is it like an A/B thing

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.280
 where people slowly move on to a new one?

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.480
 - I don't know.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.520
 I haven't gotten that far.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.800
 I do know I want some way to prove like

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.840
 with our current load that it all just works.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:31.040
 So that as we bring people over, there's not a big fear.

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.520
 But yeah, I think gradually would be the way to do it.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:34.440
 Yeah, I hadn't thought about that

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.440
 in terms of the new infrastructure in the old

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.840
 and what it would look like to kind of phase it in.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:39.880
 - Yeah.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.600
 Another thing I like about this and it's kind of ties in

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.640
 a little bit with something else on our end as well is

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.440
 this was a rewrite, which is kind of a bad word

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.640
 in the software engineering world.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.560
 Like you never do a rewrite, it's bad.

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:53.800
 If you do a rewrite, you're gonna fail.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:54.640
 - Yeah.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.640
 - Now, like it's one of those things that

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.680
 I think people still say in like a very absolute way.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:03.680
 But you're doing a rewrite from completely ground up.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:07.040
 Like you're not keeping, like it wasn't progressive.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.680
 It was, we're rewriting all of it

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.360
 and I wanna switch over.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:13.960
 We did the same thing with ST 2.0 last year

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.040
 and we flipped the switch in January.

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.840
 And while I was rewriting it,

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.400
 that was at the peak of like the rewrite controversy

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.840
 because Elon Musk said Twitter needed to be rewritten

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.080
 and everyone's like, I'm a real engineer

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.680
 and I know that you should never rewrite things.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:28.920
 I was saying that and I was sitting there

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.520
 just like rewriting every single line being like, okay,

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.120
 everyone thinks I shouldn't be doing this.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:37.000
 But as of last week, the download,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.240
 'cause we switched with a new package name.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.160
 So we have like two separate charts.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.720
 The ST 2 package crossed the SST 1 package.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.440
 There's more people using the second one in the first one.

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.300
 And that was five ish or so months.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:53.240
 So it like, yeah, of course there were some bumps

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:56.760
 that happened, but you can pull off a rewrite.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.800
 It's not something you should do lightly

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.600
 and it's definitely not like a novice thing.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.200
 Like I think you have to be pretty experienced

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.240
 to like do something like that.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.520
 But sometimes it's just necessary.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.000
 Like you can't just keep stuff around

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.840
 that's been around for super long.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.160
 And sometimes if you don't rewrite it,

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.600
 like even the small parts you refactor,

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.480
 like the bad parts grow faster

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:15.560
 than the parts that you're fixing.

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:18.000
 So sometimes you just got to do it.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.680
 - Yeah, I knew we needed to do it.

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.960
 And everyone's bought in at Stat News

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.280
 in terms of this being the right decision.

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:26.240
 But I did feel weird ever saying so publicly

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.520
 'cause it's the stigma.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.720
 It's like, I forgot about the Elon stuff with Twitter,

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.400
 but I knew it just feels bad

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:33.480
 to say you're rewriting something

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.200
 'cause you know everyone's instinct

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.040
 when they hear that.

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.760
 It's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:39.760
 Why are you rewriting it?

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.160
 Like you're from scratch?

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.080
 No, no, no, no.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.200
 That's the biggest thing you don't do.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.000
 What was like Joel Sposky or something?

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.600
 - Yeah, it was original. - Had some lists.

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.440
 Yeah.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.520
 And it's like the commandments of development.

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.640
 I was like, one of them don't ever rewrite.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:52.640
 But sometimes you have to rewrite.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:55.440
 I mean, for us, it was like an eight year old code base.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.680
 And we started stamping.

00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.600
 He's not even knowing what stamp use was.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.920
 And like we built half of it.

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.920
 It was like a spa with React.

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:05.520
 And it was embedded in this big Elixir Phoenix app.

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:07.240
 So part of it was like server generated,

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.120
 part of it was client side rendered.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.160
 It was just this big mess

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.200
 that kind of evolved over eight years.

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.120
 And it's just a lot simpler.

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.320
 Like if you look at the code base

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.160
 that we've built now with SST and Astro

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.040
 compared to the existing code base,

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:23.160
 it's just insane how much less there is there.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.200
 And it's just gonna be so much easier to work with

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.920
 as we build out new stuff.

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.240
 So yeah, it was the right move for us.

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.400
 It does feel bad to say it.

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.680
 And it feels like there's too much nuance

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.200
 to have that conversation publicly.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.040
 Yeah, I spent a lot of time in B2B.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.720
 And it occurred to me at one point

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:40.560
 that I've seen so many cases where you'll have a company

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.000
 that is an incumbent.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:42.920
 Like they've done really well

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:44.440
 and they like kind of own a market.

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:47.080
 But their product is just getting worse and worse

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:50.800
 'cause it's just built on top of just not good.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.400
 And they never do the rewrite because it's bad.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.600
 It's hard to get buy in for that.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:57.520
 It's like very resistant to like eat the cost there.

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:58.440
 But you know what happens?

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.360
 A competitor does the rewrites.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.080
 Someone new starts from ground up.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.720
 Does the rewrite they should have done?

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.680
 And they like slowly just chip away at it.

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.840
 And every B2B shift happens in this exit.

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.040
 Almost every single one I've ever seen has been like this.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:16.280
 Like I worked at a company that made software for salons.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.480
 And everyone uses this thing called mind body.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.840
 It's super old, super terrible.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:24.280
 But they just had the whole market share

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.920
 and it took this new company a while

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:28.480
 to get to feature parity.

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.400
 Maybe like two to three years.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.320
 But the moment they were at feature parity,

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:35.000
 it was just like 100% of the market was switching.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.640
 Like everyone was just switching over.

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.560
 So, and there's nothing the other company could do

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:39.400
 at that point.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.960
 So if you don't rewrite it at some point,

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.720
 like your competitor will just do it for you.

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:43.960
 - Yeah, that's great.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.240
 I never considered that.

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:47.240
 Like there's a point on the horizon

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.240
 where someone's gonna rewrite it.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.680
 It better be you.

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.040
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:52.880
 - Huh.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.080
 - Still wanna re-validate, we should talk about that.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:55.920
 - Yeah.

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:56.760
 - Just briefly.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:57.600
 - Well, you broke the news yesterday,

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.560
 which I was like, I can't believe Adam,

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.240
 'cause we were both, so for context,

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.120
 there is a caching feature in CDNs.

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:06.560
 That CDNs are supposed to support.

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:07.800
 It's called still wanna revalidate.

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:11.440
 Basically, it makes it so if it catches something,

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.000
 the next request that comes in,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.280
 it'll serve the cache version.

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:16.280
 But if it's like this is too old

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:17.640
 in the background, it'll refetch it.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:20.560
 So no one ever experiences a slow load,

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:21.760
 which is a really nice feature

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.440
 in Vercel, like built their own version of this

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.360
 and they call it ISR and people love it.

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:27.440
 But CloudFront has never supported this,

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.880
 even though the spec has been out for like,

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.080
 I think, I was trying to look,

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.120
 I think the spec for this has been out for like,

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:33.120
 maybe a decade almost.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.040
 It's been around for a while.

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:36.440
 - Fastly had it in 2014, like implemented.

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:37.280
 - Oh, okay.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.120
 Yeah, exactly.

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:39.840
 So it's almost 10 years where it's been available

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:40.800
 and they haven't had it.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.000
 And me and Adam have just kept checking,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:43.840
 like is it out?

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:44.680
 Is it out?

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:45.500
 Adam needed it for stat Muse.

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.280
 We needed it for next year's support,

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.680
 'cause we didn't wanna support ISR

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.360
 and we're like, this is the way 'til they get SLB-R.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:52.680
 Every single day, we're talking.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.520
 Like when are they gonna go?

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.040
 We talked to the CloudFront team,

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:56.520
 they're like, oh, it's coming soon, it's coming soon.

00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:01.520
 And then somehow you were the one that saw it and posted it.

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.880
 - So here's the thing.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.520
 I got a DM, my guy DM'd me.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:09.240
 You guys, you're gonna let you down.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:12.280
 But the thing is, it's in all those aggregators.

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:15.160
 If anybody had just been watching the RSS feed

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.080
 for like AWS news, they would have seen it, right?

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.360
 It was in that big feed, I'm sure.

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:23.240
 So I wasn't like, I was that special for breaking it,

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.720
 but I was special for breaking it before you.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.160
 - But was it that day, like you posted it yesterday

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:28.720
 and was that the day they posted it?

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:31.120
 - Yeah, yeah, I linked to the public article.

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.800
 He just DM'd it to me and was like, it's live.

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.680
 I think I was part of the reason I was,

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.600
 well, except it's so bad.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.440
 - Mr. AWS hero over here pulling the strings.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.360
 - No, I was one of the people

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:44.840
 that requested the feature originally.

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:47.960
 Like when I spoke about this with this person,

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.960
 it was like, yeah, we could get that on our roadmap

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.760
 and I don't know that I was the reason they built it,

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:55.160
 but I was one of the contributing factors.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.240
 I'm pretty sure that was product feedback.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.080
 - Very nice.

00:18:59.080 --> 00:18:59.920
 - Maybe not.

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:00.760
 - Good work.

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.600
 - Or maybe it's actually from the forums, I don't know.

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:07.040
 But I know that CloudFlare has had a bad implementation

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.480
 for some time.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.320
 Like, did you know this?

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:12.800
 They sort of support it, but it's not correct to spec.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.200
 - I didn't know that, that's good to know.

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.200
 - Yeah, they thought they implemented it, but it's not right.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.480
 - There's some stuff with CloudFlare

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.200
 where like, it's such a good platform, but

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.440
 I have seen CloudFront surprisingly outperform it

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:24.320
 in a bunch of cases.

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.760
 - Well, the Vercel stuff, right?

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.680
 Like all your Vercel benchmarking.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:28.520
 - Yeah.

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.120
 - That's sort of pitting AWS against CloudFlare, right?

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.440
 - Well, sort of, I would say not really,

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:35.280
 I think all the issues that came from the Vercel Edge,

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.400
 like all the slowness that came from the Vercel Edge stuff

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.680
 was probably on the Vercel side.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.000
 They must be doing additional stuff

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.160
 because people said that when they use CloudFlare directly,

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.960
 it's like crazy good performance,

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.640
 which is what I'd expect.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.400
 - Yeah, do we want to explain what it is?

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.240
 To anybody?

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.560
 - No, I kind of did.

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:51.400
 - No.

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:52.560
 (laughing)

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.840
 - Oh yeah, you did, you said it was stale.

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:55.680
 I was totally listening.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:56.960
 - Day of wallet rebalidate.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:57.800
 Wait, no, what was it?

00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:58.960
 - Sometimes, can I just say this, Dax?

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.720
 Sometimes you just don't have it, you know?

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.840
 I feel like this episode, we just,

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.320
 sometimes you just don't have your A-game,

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.400
 and I don't think we had it today.

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.360
 That's okay.

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.000
 Sometimes you just gotta phone it in, you know?

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.200
 Gotta get an episode out there.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.720
 (laughing)

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:14.160
 Just a lot of things about this episode I could do without.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.720
 Just things I said, not things you said,

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.080
 well, some of the things you said.

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:19.680
 (laughing)

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:20.520
 It is what it is.

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.160
 - Okay, well, some of our validate is out.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.360
 It's good, go use it.

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.000
 - It's good, it's on CloudFront.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.280
 To me, it means like Next.js just lost

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:31.240
 a differentiating feature to all the other frameworks.

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.840
 Like, if you deploy with SST,

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.920
 you can deploy any of those web frameworks,

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:39.440
 Solid Start, Astro, SvelteKit, whatever, even Next.js.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:43.600
 And now, there's one less thing that Next.js had

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.760
 that it's not special anymore.

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.600
 Like, all those frameworks have that feature now.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:48.720
 And it was a huge feature for me.

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:52.040
 I mean, for things I build, it was important to me.

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:53.840
 And now, granted, it's use case specific.

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.040
 Like, if you're not building something

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.640
 where that feature matters,

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.000
 and you've probably never heard of it, and you don't care.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.160
 But it is really nice.

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.880
 And to have that now in all these frameworks,

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:02.720
 I think it's pretty cool.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.560
 - Nice.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:06.640
 - Anyway, wow, this, okay, let's just stop the bleeding.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.640
 Let's just end this episode.

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:08.480
 - Okay.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.320
 (laughing)

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:10.160
 - Work it to any worse.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.440
 (laughing)

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.800
 We'll try again next time to X.

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:13.640
 - All right.

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:16.120
 - Are you really just gonna say, all right,

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:19.600
 you're not gonna acknowledge anything, just like, help me?

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:20.440
 - I don't know.

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.280
 (laughing)

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.760
 I said everything that I, what's there to say after that?

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:24.600
 - That you already thought.

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:25.440
 Okay.

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:26.280
 Well, do you agree?

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.120
 I can't really tell if you agree.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:27.960
 - I thought this was okay.

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.720
 We just didn't have a lot of stuff to talk about,

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:31.560
 but I think the stuff we talked about was good.

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:32.640
 Just not gonna be super long.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.160
 - The next one, though, that we're gonna record

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.000
 right after this one.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.660
 We're sure, like, how it's gonna be better.

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:38.600
 It's gonna go, yeah, it's gonna go so much better.

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:39.440
 - Okay.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.280
 - Well, I haven't eaten anything yet today,

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:43.180
 so I'm gonna blame it on that. - Oh, that's the problem.

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:44.140
 - And wake myself up.

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:44.980
 - Okay, good idea.

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:46.120
 I'm gonna grab a Lara bar,

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.800
 and I didn't end recording yet.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.960
 This is, okay, this is a terrible finish.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.540
 (upbeat music)
