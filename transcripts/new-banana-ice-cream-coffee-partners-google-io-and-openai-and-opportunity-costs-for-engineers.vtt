00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
 - I don't write anything down.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.880
 It's all dependent on what I remember.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.140
 (laughing)

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.260
 I remember some things.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.300
 For sure, just give me a sec.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.140
 - Okay.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.340
 - This is the beauty of editing.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.180
 Thank you, Chris.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.180
 Like it'll just seem like I just thought of it immediately,

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.580
 but it's gonna take me a good 30 seconds.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.500
 - No, he's all, whenever you say that,

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.140
 he's just gonna leave this whole thing in.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.440
 - Yeah, he just trolls us.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.980
 (laughing)

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.140
 - I love it so much.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.720
 (upbeat music)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:49.320
 - Did you change your camera position?

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.160
 - Yeah.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.000
 - You're just like close to your face now.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.840
 You're trying to match mine.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:52.680
 - Not just my camera position.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.760
 I moved my desk.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.840
 Like, I'm in a different corner of the room.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.680
 I kind of hate it.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.400
 I mean, I kind of hate that, like, everything is different.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.440
 Like, from my camera standpoint.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.680
 It's nice though, 'cause it's in the corner of my room now.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.640
 And I have so much more room in my office

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.800
 for walking around, which I don't do.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.140
 (laughing)

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.980
 For making coffee.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:12.820
 I don't know.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:13.840
 (laughing)

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.160
 I do hate, I don't have my teleprompter,

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.560
 so I'm not looking at you anymore,

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.280
 which bothers me greatly.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.400
 - Oh, we don't really, I've never looked at you, so.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.240
 - I know.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.040
 Yeah, so I'm just, it's mutual now.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.520
 We're just not looking at each other.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.520
 (laughing)

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.040
 - Yeah, well, how about, is the background look good?

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.960
 I mean, I can't really tell 'cause it's super blurred.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.800
 - My background?

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.560
 - 'Cause I think you like built your background

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.360
 around your desk being in front of it, right?

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.880
 - Yeah, you can still see most of all that stuff.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.960
 It's just oriented a little differently because of the angle.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.520
 But yeah, I mean, the background's fine.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.360
 It's all blurred out.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.600
 You can't really see it anyway.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.440
 - Nice.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.840
 So how much coffee you've been drinking?

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.680
 - Oh my God.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.560
 Okay, that's why, (laughing)

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.640
 if you saw, I mean, if you reacted in any way to my message

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.680
 earlier, that I was more than ready.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.560
 I slept really good last night,

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.600
 like got more sleep than normal.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.440
 - Wow.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.360
 - And then I woke up and I tasted like all the coffees.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.340
 And I have so much energy and I haven't eaten.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.120
 So I really considered like running around the block,

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.520
 like just sprinting to like try and get some of it out

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.600
 before we start recording.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.520
 (laughing)

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.760
 I'm a little nervous about how much,

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.040
 I'm like literally shaking, like my hand,

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.720
 I've got like a little vibration going.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.000
 - Didn't you already do this yesterday?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.120
 I feel like you've, I feel there's been like three days

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.520
 in a row where you woke up and you were like,

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.480
 I tried all of them.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.960
 (laughing)

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.880
 - I've done it more than once, yes.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.920
 It's just, it's very, it's nerve-racking.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.080
 I don't wanna get the wrong,

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.480
 like I don't wanna make the wrong choice here.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.600
 I think our partner is gonna just make it for us.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.040
 I think that's gonna be better and I can stop stressing.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.080
 But we're getting ready to like order bags,

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.120
 like thousands of coffee bags.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.280
 And we don't wanna screw this up, you know what I mean?

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.760
 - Yeah, it's funny 'cause I think,

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.760
 I remember when he was first getting into the coffee business.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.040
 So for context, we're working with my friend

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.840
 who now has a big coffee roasting business.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.800
 I know him because he founded a,

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.320
 like a messaging company, I used to work there.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.920
 - I didn't know this, I didn't know your backstory with him.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.920
 That's awesome.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.160
 - Yeah, there's a company called Inbox

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.800
 and it was just a messaging app.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.560
 This is like during the era of like

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.920
 there's being a million messaging apps

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.120
 and like kind of WhatsApp eventually won.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.400
 But it was around that time.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.680
 And it was like more than messaging app,

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.440
 it would have like a bunch of like real-time features.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.640
 And a lot of my experience from distributed systems

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.640
 comes from my work there.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.600
 It was probably the one thing I'd ever worked on

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.680
 that was at like large consumer, you know?

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.520
 And it was really fun.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.480
 It was a fun project, was not successful.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.800
 Like you just have to be massively successful

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.560
 or something like that to work.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.560
 So that ended up not working.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.560
 - Is he a developer?

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.560
 - No, he's not.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.400
 - Oh, okay.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.920
 - No, because I just realized like

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:55.760
 he was a CEO.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.600
 - I hadn't.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.440
 - Okay, got it.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.280
 - No, no.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.120
 - The CEO got it.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.800
 - His whole family is just like the most

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.760
 entrepreneurial family like I've ever met.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.440
 Like his dad just has like a bunch of different businesses

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.560
 and like the rest of the, this is kind of how they operate.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.440
 But he ended up, he ended up doing like a bunch of stuff.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.840
 And then at one point he was like,

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.880
 I'm gonna open up a coffee shop.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.120
 Not a roaster necessarily.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.200
 They were focused on building a coffee shop.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.200
 Obviously you're gonna roast your own beans if you do that.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.480
 And they went through this like crazy process.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.880
 There was some kind of like, I forgot the title,

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.040
 but he worked with some,

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.120
 I guess it was a kind of coffee sorcerer.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.520
 And I remember they did this like tasting,

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.600
 but it wasn't the point of the tasting wasn't to make coffee.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.800
 Did it something else with the bean?

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.360
 And it was like a completely different process

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.680
 and resulted in something different.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.120
 And I think like when you taste it

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.440
 that like highlights the differences in the beans more.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.360
 It was like some, they like create something

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.440
 and it's like crack it.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.400
 I don't know, it was like a really weird thing.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.240
 But I remember him doing that.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.160
 It was just like such a long time ago.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.520
 And then now they kind of,

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.840
 they still have the coffee shop

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.000
 and now they're like doing all the awesome things.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.320
 - Oh, they still have it, that's awesome.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.480
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.080
 It's one of those cool things where like

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.000
 once they have a physical space,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.320
 they can just do a million things there.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.760
 So they like, yeah.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.880
 I remember they even had like yoga sessions there

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.520
 and like all kinds of stuff.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.080
 But yeah, obviously most of the money comes from

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.520
 more stuff on the wholesale side.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.440
 - Yeah, I'm very excited to be partnering with,

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.640
 he's like a coffee nerd.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.640
 Like he knows coffee things.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.480
 - Yeah.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.600
 - And it makes me very self-conscious

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.080
 when I'm like saying anything about coffee now

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.880
 because I've seen his like cool chemistry looking set up

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.200
 and he says cool things like,

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.480
 I'm gonna cup them all today and I'll get back to you.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.000
 I'm like, oh, this guy.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.240
 - Oh, it's our thing, man, cupping coffee.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.640
 - I think he means like he's gonna make some of each.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.240
 Like he's testing, he's tasting them all.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.080
 - I see, I see.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.840
 - He's gonna like gross the, or he's gonna like brew them all

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.960
 and he called it cupping them.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.560
 And I'm like, now I'm gonna say that to people.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.080
 Oh, let me just cup some of that coffee

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.760
 and I'll let you know, I'll get back to you.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.560
 - Yeah, it's funny 'cause I think it's not like

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.200
 he was a huge coffee nerd going into it.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.320
 I think he was interested enough in it

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.760
 and then by having a business,

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.120
 you just get interested in it 'cause you have to

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.600
 and then now he's genuinely into it.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.720
 - That's how things should work, right?

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:17.720
 That's how like, it's like, you don't get a job

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.520
 that's your passion, you develop the passion.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.520
 We talked about this, I feel like we've talked about this.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.280
 But like I wasn't a passionate developer

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.200
 when I started writing code, I just like got into it

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.440
 and then you become very passionate about it

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.160
 when you spend 10 hours a day doing it your entire life.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.360
 - Yeah, it's funny 'cause people are always like,

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.200
 oh, what industry are you interested in working in?

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.040
 I've worked in so many because as a software engineer,

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.360
 you're working a bunch of industries.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.840
 - Yeah. - And every single time you show up,

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.240
 not interested in it at all

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.320
 and then once you start working there,

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.720
 you just start going deeper and deeper

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.000
 and you get like super interested in it

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 'cause like everything in the world is interesting.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.640
 - Yeah, it really is a, it's a cool profession in that way

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.880
 but I don't know if other professions get a taste of that

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.680
 but like we get to kind of like dive in deep

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.800
 on all kinds of different subjects

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.640
 and kind of get obsessed with them for a while

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.640
 while you work on that thing.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.960
 And then you know all these random things about industries

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.440
 that like you may never work in it again

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.160
 but when someone's like, you know,

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.480
 property and casualty insurance, it's a crazy industry.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.040
 I'm like, yeah, I actually do.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.880
 Let me tell you about what I know

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.120
 about property and casualty insurance.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.960
 - I mean, we're doing that with coffee right now.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.320
 - Yeah, we're deep diving.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.840
 - Yeah, it's especially funny for me

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.560
 'cause why would I know anything about coffee?

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.360
 - Right, don't even drink it.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.600
 - You're the CEO of a coffee company.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.280
 Well, are we a coffee company?

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.480
 I guess we are a coffee company

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:38.160
 but like we're bigger than that like eventually, right?

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.000
 - For now.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:39.820
 - For now.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:40.660
 Oh, I guess I'll stop there, yeah.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:43.920
 - It's, yeah, it's funny.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.560
 It gets every time we've been getting all these samples

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.280
 and Liz will try it and she'll have all these comments

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.120
 and I'll try it.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.400
 I'm like, yep, it tastes just like

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.200
 all the other coffee I ever had in my whole life.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.160
 I don't like it.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.520
 Like, you know what to me?

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.960
 It really feels like you guys just making stuff up.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:00.960
 - Like it's a sign up.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.080
 - You're having all this back and forth about like,

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:08.240
 to me what tastes like a weird flavor and too much water.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.680
 That's like what it tastes like to me.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.920
 That's what coffee tastes like to me.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.760
 - I mean, objectively, coffee is not a good taste

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.600
 but like you become adapted to it.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.360
 Like you, I started drinking it out of social pressure.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.080
 All my family drinks coffee

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.960
 and I just felt bad at family gatherings.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.440
 Like we get together like three, four times a year

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.600
 and it's like everybody's like, oh, this coffee's so good.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.520
 And I'm like, man, I can't bond over this coffee thing.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.960
 So then I start drinking it and it's like, at first,

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.720
 it's terrible but then you start to really enjoy it.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.560
 I don't know.

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:39.080
 I don't know if you enjoy the taste so much as like the effect

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.760
 and that just association with the taste

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.760
 and the effect of caffeine.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.000
 I don't know if you could ever really get

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.480
 into the taste of coffee.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.480
 I don't think you'd get into it if you just drank decaf.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.480
 Like I don't think you'd be like,

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.760
 man, this bitter coffee is delicious.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.040
 I think like it's the caffeine feeling.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.120
 It's the drug, right?

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.960
 - That's really crazy because I don't think,

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:57.800
 'cause I mean, there's a lot of things

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.280
 in the world that are acquired taste

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.320
 and I don't think I've ever acquired a taste.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.360
 - It's not just, you just refuse to acquire anything.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.880
 - I don't, it's not, it's just like,

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.080
 it's not a conscious refusal.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.840
 It's just like, it just hasn't happened for me.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.040
 So this concept of an acquired taste is really confusing.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.840
 I mean, I think to see if that's true.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.200
 - There's gotta be something in programming

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.520
 that you've developed in a choir,

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.240
 like I three or something, I don't know.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.080
 Like something that's objectively bad.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.760
 Not that I think that, but there's gotta be something

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.720
 you use that's like, it's not good,

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.160
 but you've acquired a taste for it.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.320
 - I mean, all of Linux maybe?

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.880
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.960
 - It's hard, but it is objectively good.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.200
 - Yeah, I know, I think you're gonna say

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.640
 like whatever it is, whatever you use

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:36.960
 for the last decade, you're gonna love.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.640
 - It's a difference, 'cause that just feels like

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.920
 there's a high learning curve,

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.800
 which to me feels different than like...

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.440
 - Yeah, there's a high learning curve to coffee.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.280
 - For coffee?

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.280
 - Okay, yeah.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.320
 I'm just gonna learn to like the,

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.400
 when you taste the different blends,

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.000
 like you've tasted different coffees back to back,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:52.920
 I presume?

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.560
 - Not really, I mean like actually try to like,

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.440
 like yeah, have that experience.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.600
 - Like you don't think you could actually taste the difference

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.000
 in two different, very different tasting coffees?

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.800
 - I'm sure I could, but in both,

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.040
 so I'll taste one and taste the other,

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.360
 and I'm so overwhelmed by the feeling of disgust

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:14.720
 that like I just, it's hard for me to like,

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.640
 dig through that and say this one is like the way.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.280
 (laughing)

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.400
 Yeah, I find it disgusting.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.240
 - It's repulsive to me.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.000
 (laughing)

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.520
 - Oh, it's so good.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.560
 - It's funny though, 'cause coffee ice cream, I love,

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.320
 I love the smell and I love things that are made with coffee.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.040
 - That's the smell.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.880
 Yeah, and like coffee flavored candy,

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.480
 anything coffee flavored people do generally enjoy.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:39.000
 Yeah, it's just when it's hot and like bitter

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.880
 and actual drink, not so much.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.760
 - I would love to somehow make coffee ice cream from

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:48.160
 our coffee, it's like too hard to sell,

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.040
 but it could be a--

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.040
 - You know what, that reminds me,

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.480
 we've got this new device,

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.440
 it's like my favorite kitchen appliance ever,

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.160
 I think it's only been the last couple years,

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.760
 they've started making them.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.280
 We have always made banana ice cream,

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.120
 have I told you this?

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.040
 - Yeah, yeah, you mentioned that.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.360
 Yeah, it's so good.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.200
 - It's so good.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.720
 So we would make it in like a Vitamix blender.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.480
 We've had a Vitamix for like 10 years,

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.240
 just like everything you've done for 10 years,

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.080
 we've had a Vitamix for 10 years and we love it.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.280
 We've actually, we're on our second one,

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.360
 and we actually wore the first one out.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.840
 So we make it in the Vitamix,

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.840
 but like by the time it blends up the frozen bananas,

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.960
 there's no way to get like a consistent blend

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.800
 without kind of melting it a little bit,

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.200
 the blades are at the bottom

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.200
 and it just kind of like eventually,

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.640
 it gets pretty melty like by the time you're eating it.

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:33.720
 It's still delicious,

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.600
 but like that's how we've always known banana ice cream.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.480
 And then Ninja, this company, Ninja,

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.040
 if you see me and Ninja stuff, yeah.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.320
 I guess they sell these on TikTok.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.040
 So thank you to my wife for being on TikTok.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.360
 It's the one good thing that's come out of TikTok.

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.520
 She saw this thing and it like,

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:51.240
 it has a spinning blade at the top of these canisters

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.840
 and it pushes down through a frozen block.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:58.160
 So you freeze like you pre blend something, okay?

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.240
 So like we blend up the bananas with the flavors

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.520
 that we want, peanut butter ice cream or whatever.

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.760
 And then you freeze it as a solid block

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.480
 in this little like canister

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.600
 and then the blade like moves down through it as it spins.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.440
 - Oh. - Does that make sense?

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.080
 Like it's going all the way down the canister?

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.040
 Yeah, it's called, oh, I have no idea actually.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.800
 - Is it specifically for making ice cream?

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.480
 - Yes, and it makes the most like

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.200
 from the store ice cream consistency ever.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:28.240
 It's just like you scoop it out with the ice cream scoop

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.160
 and it makes like perfect ice cream.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.520
 - Yeah, Ninja creamy.

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:32.960
 - Yes, that's it.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.520
 It's so awesome.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.160
 Like the consistency difference,

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.760
 it stays frozen for much longer.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.120
 So anyway, just like homemade ice cream with that thing.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:41.960
 - That looks really good.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:42.880
 - So good.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.160
 I recommend it.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.280
 I wish they sponsored us.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.280
 So we got something out of this.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.160
 - So is that the process for no matter what,

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.440
 even if you're making it like with milk,

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.760
 you just mix it, freeze it and then.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.200
 - Yeah, yeah, with whatever you're making.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.640
 Yeah, you just pre-freeze.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.240
 You have all these little canisters in your freezer.

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.080
 We've got like two of them.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.040
 And you just make different ice creams,

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.920
 but like it's just you blend up a liquid or not a liquid,

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.120
 but like something that you can freeze.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:06.960
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:07.800
 You get it.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:08.640
 I'm way over explaining it.

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:09.480
 - That's cool.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.520
 Yeah, my mom had an ice cream maker and even that,

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:14.080
 like this was like, I was growing up kind of

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:16.280
 and then even that was really good.

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.320
 Like homemade ice cream is really, really good.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.880
 - It's really good.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.920
 - Casey literally makes more than one every day.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.200
 Like someone is eating that stuff every single day.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.000
 We have cans, like of stuff, pre-frozen,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 filling our freezer.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:28.840
 It's awesome.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.920
 - With the banana ice cream, do you even have to add sugar?

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:32.440
 'Cause bananas are already kind of sweet.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.200
 - No, yeah, the bananas are the sweetness.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.360
 Yeah. - Oh, nice.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.080
 - Like we do like coconut cherry.

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.360
 We do like, we're not coconut cocoa cherry,

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.440
 like cocoa powder, bananas, cherries.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.600
 That's a big one we do peanut butter.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.160
 Yeah, it's, they're delicious.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.040
 I either recommend it.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:51.040
 Any smoothie recipe basically can make like a custom ice cream

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.120
 with the ninja creamy sandwich.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.720
 - That's, like, could you put like, this is messed up,

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.240
 but could you make like a green juice one

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.920
 where it's like broccoli and kale

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.680
 and you can make it into ice cream?

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.960
 - We generally put spinach in like everything

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.080
 because you can't taste it.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:07.920
 So like, we want our boys to get the benefit to the greens.

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.360
 Yeah, and it just makes everything green.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.320
 It's like every day St. Patrick's Day around here.

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.840
 It's fun, but you can't taste it.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:14.680
 - Yeah, I used to do that.

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.080
 - I used to make, for lunch every day,

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.840
 I used to make chicken, like, I used to take ground chicken

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.880
 and make like chicken patties and then have it in a sandwich.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:23.960
 And at some point, I just started throwing

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:24.800
 a bunch of spinach in there

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.280
 'cause like, yeah, why not?

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.120
 - It looks horrible though.

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.520
 It makes it come out this like disgusting green color,

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.400
 but like, it doesn't taste a flavor at all.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.520
 So it is funny how just the appearance of food can like,

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.080
 even if it didn't taste any different,

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:41.240
 it can really affect how it might goes down for you.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.840
 Like, like, I don't want to eat things

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.880
 if they look a certain way.

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.840
 Even if, you know, it's good for you

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.200
 and it doesn't affect the taste.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.240
 It can make it harder.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.480
 - Yeah, it taps into all of our senses.

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.960
 - We have a lot to talk about.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.280
 We don't always have a lot to talk about.

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:57.800
 But I have a lot to talk about.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.160
 I mean, I do. - Bring it.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.200
 I can't. - I can't feed in my system.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.520
 - Yeah.

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.400
 - Okay, where do I start?

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:09.080
 We haven't said that this episode is sponsored by Terminal.

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:09.920
 Get your coffee.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.400
 Terminal dot shop.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.240
 - But you can actually do that.

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.840
 - No, actually, you can't buy coffee right now.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.520
 - Well, unless you're like a super fan

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:18.720
 that discovered us in the future

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.800
 and when you're watching all the episodes,

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.640
 it's all the episodes. - Ooh, is that travel possible?

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.040
 This is not a thing I wanted to talk about.

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.680
 But I saw an article the other day

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.840
 that was like somebody discovered

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:31.240
 theoretically possible time travel or something.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.760
 And that's like the thing about time travel, right?

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.880
 It's always been theoretically possible.

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:38.840
 - No, I think it's my understanding back when I was like,

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:39.880
 like super into physics,

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.560
 I think it's my understanding back then was

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:45.200
 going backwards, like,

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.200
 I didn't see like any kind of mechanism

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.920
 where that would make sense.

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.600
 Going forward obviously is definitely possible.

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:52.440
 - Wait, wait, wait.

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.960
 You just said that like it was so obvious.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:55.200
 Definitely possible.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.280
 What's the thing about going forward that's possible

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:58.440
 that's not backward?

00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:59.960
 - Well, it's like if you,

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.720
 this concept of,

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.320
 you know there's a concept of time dilation,

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.120
 like we've proved in that

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:08.360
 where like different points in space

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.960
 can experience time at a different speed.

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.280
 - Right. - I'm watching them in each other.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:14.320
 - Yeah. - Yep, yep, yep.

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:16.760
 - So that guy effectively traveled to the future

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.000
 in that movie.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.280
 - Yeah, okay. - Yeah.

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.080
 And this happens with astronauts.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.760
 Like astronauts age like a tiny amount less.

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:24.600
 - Right.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.240
 That's actually, okay, I've listened to a book

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.920
 where they talk about like two twins,

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.000
 one on the top of a mountain,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.920
 the other at sea level, and like they technically--

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:33.760
 - On order of time.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.360
 - Yeah. - In the world of time or whatever.

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.160
 - I think that is it.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.000
 Yeah.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.320
 Wait, I thought you were listening to like 10 books.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.160
 - That's one of them.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.000
 - Is this one of them?

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:40.840
 - Yeah. - Oh wow.

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.080
 - Did you listen to it or did you read it?

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.800
 - I listened to everything.

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.880
 Is it like Carla-Ravelli or whatever it is?

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.360
 - Ravelli, yeah, but yeah, yeah.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.200
 - I don't know if you remember,

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.320
 but do you remember that the narration

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.920
 was exceptionally good?

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:51.880
 - I mean, yeah.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.080
 Do you know this person?

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.720
 - Well, it's like a extremely famous actor

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.120
 that narrates it with like a fantastic voice.

00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.840
 Benedict-Ravelli, I don't know if you've,

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:00.920
 I'm trying to think of what you would have seen.

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.640
 - Oh yeah, Cumberbatch, yeah.

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.120
 Wait, he did that one?

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.520
 - He did do that one.

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:06.960
 I love when he narrates a book.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.400
 - I found the book terrifying

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.480
 because it's already like crazy existential

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:11.320
 and like-

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:12.440
 - And then his voice. - And then his voice.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.280
 - And his voice.

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.960
 - Yeah, it's really scary.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.440
 - Yeah, really good audible book.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.920
 If you're into listening to books,

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.400
 that one's worth your credit.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.840
 Like, I mean, it's Benedict Cumberbatch.

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:23.400
 So like, you feel like you're watching a movie

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.440
 the whole time, but it's like crazy facts

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.120
 about time that blow your mind.

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:28.160
 - Yeah, it's completely true.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.000
 - Yeah, he talks in that book about like,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.240
 if you're on a ship traveling at speed of light,

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.440
 like the difference in time

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.400
 for that person versus someone back on earth,

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.520
 it just, the whole thing just blows your mind.

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.360
 Like the entire time my mind is just, it just hurts.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.960
 - Yeah, it's crazy that all that stuff is true.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.320
 Like it's actually really bizarre and like-

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.600
 - Seems like science fiction.

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.360
 - Yeah, yeah, but it's all accurate.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.000
 That's always been my understanding.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:51.840
 - How did we get on time?

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.120
 - You said that you saw someone

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.680
 that said time travel was possible.

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:57.560
 And I was talking about a future podcast listener.

00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:58.560
 - Oh, right, right, right.

00:17:58.560 --> 00:17:59.960
 Yeah, so a future podcast listener

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.720
 who's sipping on one of our,

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.320
 ooh, I don't want to leak things.

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:06.080
 They're sipping on coffee that we sold

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.080
 and they're listening to us like these silly guys.

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:10.000
 They don't know anything about time travel.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 I figured it out.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.360
 - Anyway, this episode sponsored by terminal,

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:15.720
 but in the future, you can buy it.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.240
 - In the future, you will be able to buy it very soon.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.080
 Well, I don't know.

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.200
 It depends on your definition of very soon.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.560
 - Things I want to talk about.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.560
 I don't write anything down.

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.320
 It's all depending on what I remember.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:31.400
 I remember some things, for sure.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.000
 Just give me a sec.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.560
 This is the beauty of editing.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:35.400
 Thank you, Chris.

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.400
 Like, it'll just seem like I just thought of it immediately,

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.840
 but it's gonna take me a 30 seconds.

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:39.880
 - Whenever you say that,

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.600
 he's just gonna leave this whole thing in.

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.080
 - Yeah, he just trolls us.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.880
 (laughing)

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:45.720
 I love it so much.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.160
 One of the things was actually about,

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.960
 it would have been so good to just bring it up

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.160
 when we were in the middle of talking about

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.000
 software engineering as a profession.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.160
 I didn't.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.880
 I've let lots of things happen between then and now,

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.440
 but I'm gonna do it, just whatever.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.960
 We're jumping back into it.

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.880
 The hardest thing about being a software developer,

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.640
 as I thought about this this morning,

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.000
 as I have four active projects going on,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.880
 is this idea of opportunity cost, I guess.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.240
 Just constantly feeling like

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.840
 there's a million things you could do.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:19.520
 We're the most leveraged profession in history, aren't we?

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.280
 We can, as an individual, do so much.

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:23.680
 I'm not bragging on this.

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:25.560
 This isn't a, I don't know.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.080
 I'm not saying we're so great.

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:30.280
 Everyone else is so whatever, peasants.

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:33.200
 But we just have this ability to completely shape

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.160
 the world around us in ways that I just don't know

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.600
 a hundred years ago if anyone had this ability.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.560
 And there's tons of us.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.280
 And we can just like wake up and choose

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:46.440
 to work on a hundred different things at any given time.

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:48.920
 And you're gonna, you're gonna select some subset

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.240
 of those things that you could be doing.

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.760
 And you're constantly gonna feel like,

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.760
 am I using my time most efficiently?

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:54.880
 Do you feel like this?

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.640
 - Now that you said all that, I feel bad saying no,

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.120
 I don't feel that.

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.160
 - No, no, it's fine.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.480
 No, I didn't run this by anybody.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.720
 - I just never thought.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.160
 - I get what you're talking about,

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.080
 but I feel like I just want to know the time

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:07.920
 to think about that.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.200
 I'm just like.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.040
 - Yeah.

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.920
 - There's just like so much, like things fly around.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.880
 You just work on whatever you can in like the moment.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.560
 I feel like I don't have time to step back and reflect.

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.560
 - And that's what I think my thought was this morning

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.360
 was like my process for choosing every day,

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.080
 what I'm gonna really like push on is basically just like,

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:25.240
 what do I want to push on?

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:27.560
 Like what do I feel like I could just like fly on right now?

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.240
 Because any day where I try to like,

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.520
 okay, I'm working on this thing today.

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:33.600
 It just goes poorly.

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.000
 Cause like that's not the thing I want to work on.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.320
 And I end up like, I don't know,

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.720
 having less productive a day

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.320
 because I was just trying to force something.

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.920
 So like on a Thursday when I feel like yesterday

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.840
 was not the best, I'm just going to like do the thing

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.560
 I want to do and I'm going to get a lot more done that way

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.640
 and feel really good about it.

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:52.480
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.720
 Is that like you've got multiple things going on.

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.720
 - Did you see my tweet about this?

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:57.560
 - No.

00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:01.240
 It's almost exactly this like two days ago or a good day ago.

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:02.080
 - Oh really?

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:02.920
 - A couple of days ago.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:03.760
 I wrote.

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:04.600
 - You tweet a lot, man.

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:05.440
 It's hard to keep up.

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.280
 - I know, I do.

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:07.120
 Like I want to keep up.

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.480
 I have notifications turned on.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:11.760
 I follow them, but it's just like I'll see one all the time

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.360
 where it's like, I didn't even see this one.

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.520
 This was a good one.

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:19.920
 - I said that everything needs to get done.

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.000
 The order doesn't matter.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.520
 Just pick what you want to do and go.

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:23.840
 - Oh, I did see that one.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.760
 So maybe it's subliminally started this train of thought for me.

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.080
 (laughs)

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:31.120
 Because it just doesn't matter.

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:35.120
 Like sometimes at SST we're like talking about

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.360
 all these things.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:39.120
 And when you step back in a long term,

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:42.520
 it actually doesn't matter at all what order they happen in.

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:45.040
 Like yeah, maybe there's like little things

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.000
 you can line up and it's technically correct.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.080
 But like you definitely can mess it up.

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.920
 But like that just, it seems way more likely

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:55.840
 that your plan is actually inefficient

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:58.840
 'cause your motivation day to day is different.

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:01.560
 So yeah, it's really freeing just to like work

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:02.400
 on what you want.

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.800
 - Can I counter point here?

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.880
 I think every developer can relate with this.

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:10.040
 It does matter in the areas where you touch the outside world.

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:14.440
 So like I have four very active things right now

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.840
 that I'm working on and it's four completely different groups

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:19.400
 of people, stakeholders, if you will.

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:20.920
 So they care what order I do today.

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:21.920
 (laughs)

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:26.920
 Like the teams that are involved ultimately

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:28.880
 might have a care, you know?

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:31.360
 If like I decided I'm just gonna work on one for a month,

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.040
 they'd be like, you know, maybe don't do that.

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.680
 - I think with a lot of these things that I say,

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:40.160
 I'm not expressing a truth about the world.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:44.360
 I think I'm more expressing the thing I won't trade off,

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:46.200
 the thing that I like change.

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:49.000
 Change everything else before I change this type of thing.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:49.840
 - I see.

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:50.680
 - Yeah, you're right.

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:54.520
 - I see situations where like what I'm saying is like ridiculous,

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:57.400
 but I'm more likely to change a situation than to change.

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.240
 - Yeah.

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:03.040
 - That and I describe it to an extreme, but yeah, I don't know.

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.200
 To me, it just feels like at least with the work I'm doing,

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.160
 it's just all needs to get done, so.

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.000
 - Yeah.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.280
 It's really interesting like how many constraints

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.720
 I think can't be changed.

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:14.680
 And then when I step back and I read one of your tweets

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.360
 or you say something like that, it's like,

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:17.680
 oh yeah, everything is changeable.

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:21.040
 Like I could literally just like wake up and decide

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:23.840
 I'm not doing that anymore, that kind of thing.

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:27.120
 I'm veiling a lot of this, but like, yeah.

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:28.520
 - The thing I'm actually worried about

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:33.520
 is that I have gotten used to such a luxurious way of being.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.760
 When I say luxurious, I mean personally,

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.320
 like I feel like so much is aligned.

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:38.720
 - Lifestyle?

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.160
 - Yeah, like in terms of my work,

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.560
 I feel like so much is like aligned exactly perfectly.

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:45.400
 Like who I'm working with, what I'm working on.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.280
 There's just like, there's so many like 1% scenarios

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:50.040
 for each of one of those things.

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:53.880
 And I'm like, is there a situation where like,

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.720
 that falls out of alignment?

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.320
 And I can't really get back there.

00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:00.200
 And then I just like am extra miserable

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.160
 'cause I had a, like I think about like with ST,

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.960
 like that's to me, it's like a great team.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.160
 I don't ever wanna work on a team worse than that,

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.960
 or like worse than any way, worse than like,

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:13.480
 just on the work we're doing, like the type of relationships

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:17.080
 we have each other, like how our personalities mesh.

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:18.880
 But that's like impossible.

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.600
 Like that's really, really rare.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:24.400
 So, yeah, there's like a chance

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.640
 that I never get that again, so that does worry me.

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:29.320
 - Yeah, I used to have this thought

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:32.480
 like five, six years ago about remote work.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.600
 Like I've just, I started my career remote

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:38.920
 and I had worked at that point, you know, five or six years

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.600
 remote and it was kind of like,

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:41.520
 - What if this went away?

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:44.000
 What if I had to actually get a job and go somewhere?

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.400
 Because like, I just didn't have a remote option anymore.

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.160
 'Cause back then it wasn't like a given.

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.680
 It's more of a given today.

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:51.320
 But even now, I mean, there's people doing

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.200
 the return to office stuff and it's like,

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.560
 I gotta move my family to Seattle now, that sucks.

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.520
 That was very transparent.

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:58.800
 - What do I'm talking about?

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:01.320
 (laughing)

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:04.280
 - AWS, AWS returned to office thing

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.160
 and now I rest and moved to Seattle.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:10.320
 Yeah, it's like five, six years ago.

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.680
 That was very much a thought that I would have

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:14.640
 and I'd talk with Casey, like, what happens

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.720
 if I just have to like, get a job somewhere

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.080
 and actually not work in the home?

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.200
 We've had to play that out in the past.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:25.120
 Well, we didn't have to, I just worry a lot, so.

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.600
 - Yeah, no, but that's definitely a part of it too.

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:32.520
 It's, yeah, just, just when everything is like correct,

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:35.120
 it just feels really fragile too.

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:35.960
 - Yeah.

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.120
 - The counter point to that I think is that

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.640
 as your career in life goes on,

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:42.520
 you're just, you're building up a bigger and bigger foundation.

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:45.360
 So you just have more ability to choose

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.880
 what you want your life to be.

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:49.840
 Like, I feel like I just enter the phase where I'm like,

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:52.560
 able to choose in my life, like in the past couple of years.

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:53.400
 - Yeah.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.720
 - I'm able to like, select certain things in my life

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:58.400
 where, up till then it wasn't like,

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.480
 I basically have to have no choice at all.

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:01.480
 I don't have to do whatever.

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:02.800
 - Yeah, we definitely talked about this.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.840
 I don't know if we've talked about it on the podcast

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:06.720
 or just in DMs, but like the idea

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.440
 that the first half of my career,

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.240
 and I know you've said something similar,

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:11.880
 was just like doing stuff.

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:13.080
 You weren't being choosy.

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:15.360
 It was just like, whatever anybody would pay you to do,

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:17.120
 maybe not whatever anybody would pay you to do.

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:20.080
 But I did a lot of stuff that was just like,

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.680
 if you'll pay me to program, then I will do that work.

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.680
 And then as your career goes on,

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:27.240
 you get a little older, you get to be way more selective.

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.640
 So maybe the thing I said earlier

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.640
 about like having so many options,

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:32.800
 maybe that's a kind of like first world problem,

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.080
 but not everybody feels that way.

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.280
 But at least at this stage of career,

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:39.540
 it feels like I could wake up and decide to work on

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:41.280
 any one of a hundred different things

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:44.840
 that sound like a good idea with some smart person,

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:49.000
 but like you have to choose a few.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.520
 If you ever wish, you just had one thing going on, sorry.

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:52.360
 Have I said that before?

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:53.200
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:54.040
 I always think about that.

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.720
 I'm always like, would I be just so much better

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:57.560
 if there was like--

00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:00.560
 - Is it impossible for us, like people in our position

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.840
 to just choose one thing and work on that thing only?

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.920
 - I think my issue is I can work

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:07.640
 in many, many, many hours,

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:11.920
 but I think for me there's,

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:14.040
 I get into like many different moods

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:18.120
 throughout those hours, like I might feel like working on

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.400
 a bunch of like framework-y stuff for SSC for a while,

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.520
 then I might feel like working on a bunch of front-end stuff

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:24.280
 and then I might feel like working on some like,

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:26.720
 just something not really a programming at all.

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.040
 - Yeah.

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:30.280
 - So I think there's, it's hard to find one project

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.960
 that scratches all those itches, I guess.

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:33.480
 - Yeah, if I just have one project,

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:34.760
 I think I would just work fewer hours.

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:36.240
 I think that's the result.

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:39.720
 - So there's like a fantasy, but I don't think it's real.

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:43.840
 - So I do actually work a lot fewer hours than I used to,

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.160
 like that, but you know what?

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.920
 I had this thought, you two,

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:51.040
 I wondered if it was just because of having kids,

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:53.320
 but I have this thought the other day,

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.040
 I think I thought about tweeting it even.

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.240
 And then I didn't see, when I have thought sometimes Dax,

00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:58.160
 I just don't tweet them.

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.600
 What's that like, do you just tweet every thought?

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:01.440
 - No.

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:03.280
 The moment I think it's already out on Twitter,

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:05.160
 like it just feels like one-in-one motion.

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:08.720
 - You literally think straight into a tweet,

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.080
 just go straight from your brain.

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:13.240
 It doesn't even, like, it's not conscious at all.

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:15.320
 Now I had this thought that like,

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:20.400
 I used to work at least like, I don't know, 55, 60 hours.

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:23.040
 I used to know the number because it was very like,

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:26.680
 not legislated, what's the word I'm looking for?

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:28.600
 It had been discussed a lot with my wife.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.160
 What was it?

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.000
 What was the word?

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.760
 - No, it's a transactional, but I don't think that was right.

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:36.080
 - No, like when a judge, what is the word,

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:37.320
 like it had been--

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:39.000
 - Negotiated, Paul.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.360
 - There's a word here, and I just can't think of it.

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:42.760
 It's gonna drive me crazy.

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:45.800
 But like, oh, no, not legislated.

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.320
 What is the word?

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:49.520
 When someone like sues somebody and like,

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:53.640
 the stuff comes up in court, there's a word you use--

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:54.480
 - Litigated.

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.160
 - It's like, litigated, yes.

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:58.400
 So I used to have the number very ingrained in my brain

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.560
 because it had been very litigated with my wife.

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:01.400
 - I see, I see.

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.360
 - It had come up a lot.

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:03.400
 Like, how many hours have worked?

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.200
 But it was like, whatever, 60 hours are like, let's say.

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.520
 Like, when we first started stabbing,

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.360
 it was like early startup days.

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:13.360
 It was a lot of hours, had a very young family.

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:16.360
 So like, just a baby, just one, one baby.

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:18.200
 And it was like, work a ton.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:22.120
 And then that's been like, cut in half over the last decade

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:24.800
 to the point where I have very little hours

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.080
 that I actually work.

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.760
 Like, I feel like compared to then,

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:31.040
 I work a lot less hours, but you know what it did for me?

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:34.280
 It just like, made me not have any distractions

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:36.240
 'cause I don't have time for any distractions.

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:40.280
 Like, I don't have fluff in my day anymore.

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:42.800
 I still probably like wish I had a little bit more bandwidth

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:46.920
 sometimes, but like, when I worked so much,

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.520
 well, I guess, now that I think about it,

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.040
 this is totally invalid.

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:53.600
 I just lied because when I was working 60 hours a week,

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.120
 it's not like I was like distracted.

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:57.720
 Like, it was just literally working that much more.

00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:58.840
 - You know what the answer is?

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:02.200
 - I think that I've gone through the exact same thing.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.760
 And I think back to like, I spent so many,

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.760
 like, I've spent several years where I would just like,

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:11.440
 wake up on my laptop, fall asleep with my laptop,

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.560
 wake up on my laptop, what the hell was I doing?

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:15.000
 It turns out I was just dumb.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.640
 I was just a lot dumber back then.

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:17.480
 I think that's the real answer.

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:18.240
 - That's what it is.

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.280
 We're getting better.

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:20.120
 - I think that's the real answer.

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:21.080
 I think we're getting better.

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.040
 The technology's getting better.

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.760
 The same, like, I can't believe it.

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:26.360
 I think back to some of the products that I built.

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:29.080
 And I'm like, why did it take me so long?

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:30.840
 And why did I need to write it three times?

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.240
 - You just tweeted something.

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:33.880
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:36.480
 Like, I'm working on, like, we're back to working on

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.120
 that ST console.

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.880
 And this, like, really simple crud stuff for terminal.

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.720
 I'm like, this is like what normal work is like?

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:46.120
 This is so easy.

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:48.120
 There's nothing to think about, you know?

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.440
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:52.080
 - With SST, every single second of my day is like,

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:53.240
 what is the future?

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:55.040
 How do we position ourselves against it?

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:56.880
 Like, what's gonna happen, what they are doing?

00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:58.440
 And it's just like, there's just so much, like,

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.440
 up in the air and it's vague and confusing.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:02.800
 And then, and then for, like, terminal, it's like--

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:03.720
 - It's not a little crud thing.

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:04.560
 You're like, this is easy.

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:05.400
 - Or these commerce sort.

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.760
 You need the cost of an order product, product variance.

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:08.600
 And then that's it.

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.920
 Like, you just shove in a database and you're done.

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:12.720
 And I'm just like, this is what most people work on.

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:16.320
 Why are they, like, just talking about all these little

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:17.680
 things all the time.

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.080
 (laughing)

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:22.560
 I'm actually very convinced that, and I said it's the other day,

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:27.560
 deep in some thread, where I think as an engineer,

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:31.080
 you have a natural desire to, like, want to build

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:34.080
 abstractions and solve, like, engineering problems.

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:34.920
 - Yeah. - 'Cause it's fun.

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:37.200
 It's like a fun puzzle, it's very satisfying.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.160
 Everyone has a desire.

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:39.000
 - Yeah.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.280
 - I think what I, and I remember being a lot like that,

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:43.280
 and I think, and everyone has, like, different

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:44.200
 varying degrees to it.

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.600
 I think I had, like, I had this, like, feeling intensely,

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:47.800
 'cause I would definitely spend a lot of time

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:52.080
 over doing that with stuff I didn't need to be doing that with.

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:53.800
 But then, I got an outlet for it.

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:55.960
 Like, I got an outlet for it with SST, where that, like,

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:59.120
 actually makes sense for me to, like, put the energy into.

00:31:59.120 --> 00:31:59.960
 - Yeah.

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.280
 - So now, when I go and work on something normal,

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:03.760
 I don't want any of that at all.

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:05.520
 Like, I don't care about any of that.

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.280
 I just want it to be, like, really straightforward

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:08.800
 and simple, and whatever. - Yeah, yeah.

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:10.960
 - So, like, I'm, like, not at risk of it,

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:12.120
 and I got this outlet.

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:14.160
 I think most engineers don't have the outlet,

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:18.200
 so they force it into whatever they're working on.

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.520
 - That makes sense.

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:22.840
 Everyone's just kind of, like, faded to be in that zone.

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.840
 - So, that's another benefit of having, like,

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:26.160
 a few irons on the fire,

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:27.920
 as you get to, like, scratch all these itches,

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:30.800
 and then, ultimately, your work is better for it.

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:33.680
 - Yeah, like, I think the tweet that I originally posted was,

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:35.480
 and I've noticed with all of this

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:36.800
 with a bunch of framework authors,

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.160
 when they, when you go look at them,

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:40.960
 when they build, like, something normal,

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:44.120
 they just don't use anything, anything.

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:47.440
 Like, every single framework author does not use ESLint.

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:49.320
 And if you go out and say that,

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:51.880
 I don't use ESLint, a lot of people will be,

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:53.680
 we'll say that you're wrong or you're bad about a lot.

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:54.520
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:56.560
 - But every single framework author does not use ESLint.

00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:58.800
 And, like, stuff in that category, they just don't have,

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:01.720
 like, when I go look at other companies' repos,

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:04.920
 and I go look at their root port of repo,

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:07.040
 there's, like, 20 files in the root.

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:08.560
 And it's like, what is this?

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:10.720
 Oh, we're using, like, all this stuff.

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:11.720
 - Yeah.

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:12.880
 - And to me, like--

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.520
 - You have, too, when you have, like, a big team,

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:16.000
 and you, they're all just dumb.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.400
 Is that, is that the idea?

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:18.360
 - No, I don't think so.

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:19.200
 I don't think it's that.

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.600
 I just, I just think that, like--

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:21.440
 - Sorry if I fit it.

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:25.280
 - There's just, they just don't have the outlet, you know?

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:27.360
 They don't have the outlet for--

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:28.200
 - Yeah.

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:31.120
 - I think it's just that, as much as it feels totally rational,

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:33.360
 but I think it's really, like, you're definitely biased

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:35.320
 by not having an outlet for that energy.

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:40.320
 - Is this also related to your e-commerce platform

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:43.600
 versus someone targeting e-commerce customers' tweet?

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:44.440
 - I don't think so.

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.960
 - No, okay, I'm reading into it.

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.920
 I just didn't understand that tweet, that's all.

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:51.480
 This reminds me of something completely different, too.

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:54.720
 Did you see me on the other thing about how I said,

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:58.000
 I don't understand how notable open source people

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.640
 keep finding themselves in situations

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:02.680
 where they're not, like, super happy, like, career-wise.

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:05.080
 - No, I don't think I saw this.

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:06.720
 I probably liked it.

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:09.280
 - I wrote it about how, like, I don't know

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.960
 how notable open source people

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:13.760
 don't leverage themselves into better positions or something.

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:14.760
 - Oh, I did see this, yeah.

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:16.920
 - Yeah, a bunch of people reply to me being, like,

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:19.400
 seeing all kinds of things, like...

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.480
 - Oh, and I went for the money.

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:23.080
 - It depends on your measure of happy

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:25.040
 and, like, what is success?

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:26.080
 - Yeah, all that stuff.

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:27.760
 But, like, if you look at what I said,

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.080
 I actually didn't say anything about that.

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:30.920
 I just said into better position.

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:33.240
 'Cause my whole point here was,

00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:34.440
 and we were talking to those earlier, right,

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:36.080
 when you have a lot of options,

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:37.960
 you get to pick your life more.

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:41.160
 And that's, like, very clear to me.

00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:44.560
 It's like, if you can generate 100 options for yourself,

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:46.160
 then you can say no to a bunch of them

00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:48.520
 and, like, be really, or, like, wait for the right option

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:50.320
 to come around, like, you know,

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:52.840
 kind of benefit from timing a little bit better.

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.520
 And I feel like when you're an open source developer,

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:56.040
 that's somewhat notable.

00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:58.240
 People are just entering in your life, like,

00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:59.240
 without you doing any work.

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:01.240
 Like, there's people using your app.

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:03.200
 They're messaging you about it.

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.320
 They're submitting PR, just companies using it.

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:06.280
 They, like, talk to you.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:08.440
 Like, the networking part of your life

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:10.320
 is just, like, supercharged, right?

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.440
 You don't do anything, people just enter your life.

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:15.320
 And it's, like, crazy to me that people don't see that

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:18.680
 as, like, if I just invest, like, a little bit

00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:19.880
 into, like, that part of it,

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:20.720
 you don't have to do too much,

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:23.640
 'cause you're way better stuff than anyone else.

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:25.680
 You can then, like, just have a ton of options

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:27.520
 and then pick whatever life you want.

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:30.600
 'Cause I think I see so many open source people being, like,

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:32.320
 oh, like, I don't have time to work on this thing

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:34.760
 I wanna work on, because, like, I have this job

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:36.200
 that I don't really like, and, like,

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:37.600
 they're just doing it forever.

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:41.200
 And, yeah, it's weird to me that, like,

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.840
 there's, like, this career-mindedness thing

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:44.120
 that you just need a little bit of,

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:46.640
 but I think a lot of people just don't have any of it.

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:49.800
 - Yeah, I mean, I can, I'm not gonna say names,

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.360
 but I can think of examples where I feel like

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:53.120
 they could have better situations, for sure.

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:54.960
 I'm sure everyone could think of that,

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.640
 just for the public perception, at least.

00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:58.960
 - Yeah, you take some examples where it has worked out,

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:01.120
 like, I mean, take Rich Harris, for example, right?

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:03.920
 He mates felt, spelt good, all that stuff.

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:05.840
 And now he's blubbers himself into a position

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:08.600
 where he just gets paid to work on that full-time.

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:09.440
 - Yeah.

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:11.040
 - And if you have any kind of framework

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.480
 that's remotely that successful,

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.040
 like, you should be able to do that too, you know?

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:16.360
 - Yep.

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:18.280
 - But yeah, people find it difficult, I guess.

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:20.160
 - Okay, that's a good segue.

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:21.680
 First take quick break while I pee.

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:22.520
 - Okay.

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:23.440
 - And this is an episode where we're,

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:24.840
 I'm gonna come back after that,

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.160
 'cause we've got more to talk about.

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:27.160
 But I have to pee.

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:28.440
 Well, I also had a lot of caffeine.

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:30.440
 So it's maybe just earlier than normal.

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:31.280
 I'll be right back.

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:32.400
 Is it just pee?

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.960
 'Cause I know caffeine does all their stuff to you.

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:35.640
 - Yeah, yes, next.

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:37.040
 This just got really weird.

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:38.040
 Yes, I just have to pee.

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:39.200
 I'll be right back.

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:40.040
 - Okay.

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:42.640
 (upbeat music)

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:50.160
 - I, well, before we move on,

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.680
 I just, I was just looking at something.

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:57.280
 Did you see that GameStop stock is surging again?

00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:01.320
 - No, is this the Wall Street Bets thing again?

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:02.160
 - Yeah.

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.400
 - Robin Hood, the whole thing?

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:05.880
 - It jumped from $10 to 50,

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:07.360
 and that roaring kitty guys back,

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:09.040
 they got it, like, leads all this stuff.

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:09.880
 - Yeah.

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:12.640
 - And this time, I'm like, I'm not just gonna watch,

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:15.160
 but I'm on the evil side.

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:16.720
 - Do you have skin in the game?

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:20.920
 - Yeah, I bought puts, put options against it.

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:22.760
 'Cause I'm like, we saw this play out.

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:23.600
 - 'Cause it's definitely gonna fall.

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:24.920
 - Yeah, we saw this play out before.

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:27.280
 Like, I bought, I bought put options

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:29.160
 like far into the future,

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:31.640
 and like, I don't even know who's writing these options.

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:33.440
 Like, why the fuck would you take those all you think?

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:34.680
 (laughing)

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:36.360
 I mean, there's complicated reasons why.

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.800
 But anyway, yeah,

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:40.360
 it's already like, fallen a bunch.

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:43.160
 And we'll see, I was looking at it historically,

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:46.080
 and like, it jumped up,

00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:49.040
 and then crashed like crazy, like crazy amount.

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:51.160
 Then jumped up again, almost as high.

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:54.120
 Like, these swings are crazy, and it like lasted.

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:58.560
 It took like, it took a very long time for it to get back,

00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:01.000
 you know, it's still actually not as low as it used to be.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.480
 I don't know if it's something about the business change,

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:06.320
 but yeah, like I said, they're trying it again.

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.320
 - Interesting.

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.760
 - And I made a whole movie about it already,

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:10.800
 and now I guess I only got to make it sequel.

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:11.640
 - Yeah.

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:13.520
 - And it seems there too.

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:15.080
 Wow.

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:17.160
 - I just love that you're in this now.

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:19.960
 Like, another trip to Europe is on the line.

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:20.800
 - I love it.

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:21.640
 - Exactly.

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:23.200
 (laughing)

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.040
 - Just a few weeks ago.

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:26.400
 - We used to come up every year in two weeks,

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:27.840
 not this weekend with a weekend after that.

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:28.680
 Yeah, I'm excited.

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:29.920
 - Yeah, it's really interesting actually.

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:32.280
 This is a side tangent,

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.720
 if there is such thing on our show.

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:37.960
 But just the idea of like, markets have been around so long,

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:39.800
 and then like technology has come along,

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:42.800
 and obviously they've like evolved with technology,

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:44.680
 but like they're not really,

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:48.200
 are they really evolved to the point

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:50.280
 of like modern day social media?

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:51.160
 I mean, obviously not.

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:53.320
 Like this whole GameStop thing is an example

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:58.320
 where it's just like things weren't prepared

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:02.680
 for this level of like coordination and memes,

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:06.120
 and it's just like completely broke markets.

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:08.860
 And they've now had to adapt more because of it, right?

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.680
 - Yeah, I mean, I would argue this is actually

00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:13.160
 been the exact history of the market always.

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:15.320
 It's like someone finds a strategy,

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:16.640
 and it's unique and novel,

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:19.840
 and it starts to produce really crazy results.

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.200
 And then market adapts,

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.720
 and then that strategy's no longer viable.

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:26.040
 And which is why most headphones,

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:29.760
 they go, they like shut down after like five or six years.

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:32.160
 That's like the average time of the hedge fund.

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:33.000
 - Yeah.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.320
 Whatever world idea that no longer works, that's working.

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:38.520
 So that's why when you see the ones that are like

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:40.400
 30, 40 years old.

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:41.800
 - They're positive schemes.

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:42.640
 - Oh, sorry.

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:43.960
 (both laughing)

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:44.800
 - It's made up.

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:49.120
 - Maybe, or you know, it's actually really impressive

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:51.640
 because it's quite hard to do something like that.

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:53.280
 - To live that long.

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:55.240
 - Okay, so there's things I want to talk about.

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:56.080
 - Yeah.

00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:58.720
 - Or there's a thing I want to talk about.

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:01.880
 And I think we've talked about this before, maybe.

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:02.720
 I don't know.

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:03.560
 It doesn't matter.

00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:04.400
 Who cares?

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:07.720
 Just like the idea of,

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:10.880
 and I don't want to say this in a way

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:15.080
 that sounds like I'm like disagreeing with somebody

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:16.560
 'cause I'm not.

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:17.760
 Okay, I'm going to use a different word.

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:18.760
 - You are disagreeing with them.

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:20.160
 Just spit it out.

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:22.880
 - Yeah, but it's like I'm not, I am, but I'm not.

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:23.800
 You know what?

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.560
 Oh, I can't say that either.

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:26.400
 (both laughing)

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.120
 This is so hard.

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:29.120
 Sometimes I'm negative.

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:29.960
 You know what I mean?

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:33.120
 Sometimes I'm just, sometimes I'm pessimistic

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:36.560
 or I'm negative in ways that like,

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:39.440
 I feel like I should apologize.

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:40.560
 I shouldn't apologize.

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:41.840
 I don't feel like I should apologize,

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:43.480
 but I feel like people think I should apologize

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:45.040
 for being negative.

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.360
 And here's my thought on it.

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:49.720
 My thought is my wife and I figured this out

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:52.720
 because in our relationship, in our marriage,

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:56.040
 I am the optimistic, everything's going to work out

00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:59.640
 in our life and like, look at all that's in front of us.

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:02.040
 And I've always been that way for 15 years we've been married.

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:05.960
 I've always been like, oh man, the future is so bright.

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:10.440
 And she in turn has to be like the Debbie Downer,

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:11.920
 the like wet blanket on my,

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:14.800
 she has to pull me back down to earth and I need that.

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:17.200
 Or I will spin off into orbit,

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:21.400
 into some manic craziness like, and I do sometimes.

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:22.720
 But like she has to kind of be like,

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:25.880
 let's put a little, we'll put the brakes on a little bit.

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:29.760
 And I think every situation where there's somebody

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:33.160
 to one extreme, you have to kind of like pull it back

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:34.680
 or it just gets out of balance.

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:38.240
 So she ends up feeling like she's constantly being a pessimist.

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:40.360
 When she's not, like about other things in life,

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:41.200
 she wouldn't be that way.

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:42.720
 But she feels like in our relationship,

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:46.800
 she has to like be the like realistic one.

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:47.920
 And I think that's the case.

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:52.560
 I think like on Twitter, just translating that dynamic

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:54.560
 to the internet, I think when there's people

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:58.600
 that are just overly fluffy and toxically positive,

00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:00.800
 then people have to pull it back the other way.

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:03.600
 And if I gotta be that person, I'll be that person.

00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:05.560
 And I don't think it's right to be like,

00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:07.360
 everyone should be positive all the time.

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:09.160
 If you're negative, you suck.

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:10.560
 'Cause that's stupid.

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:11.440
 Okay.

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:13.280
 - Yeah, I have a bunch of thoughts on this.

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:16.880
 So one, I think there's this weird dynamic where,

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:19.440
 okay, so when you're like in the position

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.680
 of like being somewhat of a public figure,

00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:25.480
 people start to put all these responsibilities on you

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:29.200
 that are no one ever discussed.

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:30.840
 It's just kind of the people talk about it

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:32.000
 like it just assumed.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.840
 So for example, I obviously make fun of Next.js a lot.

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:39.420
 I think we're applied being like,

00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:43.720
 so we're applied being like,

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:46.600
 some of them that use Next.js, they were like,

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:49.080
 hey, like why do you do this so much?

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:51.680
 Like, yeah, I don't know, they didn't like it.

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:52.680
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:54.160
 - And my reply to them was like,

00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:59.440
 I don't have, there's no like reason

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:02.280
 that I need to like meet some standard

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:04.040
 that you have created in your head.

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:05.520
 Like I'm just a person.

00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:08.240
 And as a human, sometimes I find stuff funny

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.520
 and I want to make fun of it.

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:11.200
 Sometimes I want to be positive about something.

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:12.800
 Sometimes I want to shit on something.

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:14.240
 Sometimes I don't feel good

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:16.080
 and I like express myself in a certain way.

00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:18.120
 Other times I'm very, very articulate.

00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:19.320
 I'm just a human person

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:22.280
 and you're okay to find some of that behavior annoying.

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:24.200
 Just like every person in your life,

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:25.280
 sometimes they're being annoying,

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:26.760
 sometimes they're being great.

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:30.360
 Why is like, but for some reason,

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:31.840
 when it comes to like this type of thing,

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:33.480
 like people have to be like this paragon

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:36.080
 of like some concept.

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:39.280
 And a lot of people put that on themselves

00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:40.680
 and they start acting in a way

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:42.760
 that I actually think is completely cowardly

00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:44.920
 if I'm just going to be straight up.

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:47.880
 Like this, the thing that you're referring to,

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:50.480
 like this like overly positive thing

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:52.400
 to me is like one of the most cowardly things

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:53.520
 you can possibly do.

00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:56.140
 There's so many things that just sound good to everyone

00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:59.000
 that you can just constantly say over and over and over.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:43:59.840
 - Yeah.

00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:00.680
 - You can actually dig into it.

00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:01.520
 They're completely devoid of meaning.

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:02.440
 They're completely devoid of risk.

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:04.720
 They're completely devoid of any kind of sacrifice

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:06.720
 or like thinking or like taking a stand.

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:08.720
 So like, you know, it's,

00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:11.600
 there's so much feel good stuff out there

00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:12.880
 that people are demanding from you

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:14.080
 that everyone wants you to like, you know,

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:16.320
 say these things and then a bunch of people say those things

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.120
 and people are like, oh, yeah, that's so great.

00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:20.600
 And you're like, you're so enlightened and it's wise,

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:21.800
 but it's really not.

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:26.000
 So yeah, it's just like everyone is just a person

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.160
 and people are complex in different situations.

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:31.400
 They're not going to like be this one dimensional thing

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:33.560
 that you're demanding of them.

00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:34.400
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:35.720
 Yeah. And I feel like it's,

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:39.840
 there's a dichotomy for me, like in person,

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:42.120
 I am a person from the Midwest

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:45.200
 and I have a lot of like stuff I have to work through

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:49.560
 that's like, fakeness, like a layer of glossy fakeness

00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:51.600
 that I just can't like shed

00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:54.200
 when it comes to in-person social interactions.

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:56.600
 But on the internet, I don't feel like I have that as much.

00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:58.000
 I feel like I can just be myself

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.240
 or say what I actually think.

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:02.080
 So I do have this weird like,

00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:04.840
 maybe I overcompensate for my Midwesternness on the internet

00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:07.720
 and I'm too something at times.

00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:11.680
 But I don't know, I don't feel bad for saying things

00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:16.360
 that are maybe negative or like pulling back

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:18.840
 in opposite directions from things that I feel like,

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:20.720
 sorry, my kids are just screaming so loud.

00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:22.120
 It's very distracting.

00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:23.440
 I don't know if it's coming through,

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:26.880
 but one of them is very upset with the other.

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:29.640
 Maybe that's a metaphor, it's in this situation.

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:33.000
 Sometimes you just, you're in a bad mood

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.720
 or something just annoys you

00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:37.200
 and it's okay to say that online.

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:39.880
 And everything I say is not going to be like,

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:43.040
 let's think best-case scenario and be positive.

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:45.000
 - Yeah, and it's like if people don't like it,

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.680
 they can unfollow you and you're just,

00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:47.960
 you're just doing your express yourself

00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:50.040
 and everyone just can't do that.

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:52.320
 And this whole thing where people are like

00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:54.680
 trying to police being like, that was bad.

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:56.960
 Like I'm judging you 'cause that was bad.

00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:00.280
 It's really weird to do that in real life.

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:01.920
 It's like really, really, really weird.

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:04.720
 Like you have friends and sometimes they,

00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:05.920
 they things that are annoying,

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:07.840
 but they're still your friend, you know?

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:09.680
 If they go over the line, they stop being your friend.

00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:10.800
 And that's okay, you know?

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:11.640
 - Yeah.

00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:15.480
 - So it's just like, it's really weird.

00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:18.120
 But one interaction I had when I said that,

00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:20.680
 the other person was like, they like actually heard it.

00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:21.520
 They like, they got it.

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:22.920
 They're like, oh, okay.

00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:23.760
 - Yeah.

00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:24.960
 - 'Cause they're like, that actually does make sense.

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:26.960
 Like I can find you annoying and you are allowed

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:27.800
 to be annoying.

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:28.640
 It's actually that simple.

00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:29.480
 - It's that simple.

00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:30.320
 - Yeah.

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:35.560
 The other thing is like people love to judge moments

00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:38.720
 and like moments can look really bad out of context.

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:41.800
 So if you are being negative,

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:44.280
 because one thing happened to you once,

00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:46.360
 okay, I can see why someone would judge you for that.

00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:49.160
 If you're being negative after like a year of frustration,

00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:50.960
 that's like a totally different story, right?

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:54.680
 So yeah, people just wanna like take like single sentences

00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:57.120
 and be like, that was a good one or that was a bad one.

00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:59.840
 And it's just nothing is that simple, you know?

00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:02.520
 - It's also complicated as I'm thinking through it

00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:04.920
 because like it might be the first time

00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:07.880
 they've seen anything from you or the three things

00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:09.720
 they've seen from you were pretty negative.

00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:12.440
 And it's like, for them it is a pattern.

00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:14.720
 But like they don't have the broader context.

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:15.640
 It's complicated.

00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:18.560
 It's amazing that anybody likes anybody actually.

00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:20.760
 We're all just awful.

00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:22.880
 - That dynamic you talked about is actually so funny

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:25.080
 'cause I'll get comments like,

00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:27.840
 oh, wow, you like do post smart stuff once in a while.

00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:31.160
 But like, and then it's to me it's like,

00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:33.920
 they must have just been seeing like all my dumb posts

00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:34.760
 back to back.

00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:37.340
 'Cause I feel like I like do both every single day,

00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:39.360
 but there's a chance that you only sit dumb ones every day.

00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:40.240
 - You only sit dumb ones?

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:42.080
 - Yeah, and then at one time you see a smart one

00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:44.040
 and you're like, huh, this is like a totally different person

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:45.400
 than I thought they were.

00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:46.680
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:48.920
 - So you definitely come off one dimensional

00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:50.180
 because of the way that whole thing works.

00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:53.840
 - Yeah, and it's funny like, I don't know if you do this,

00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:58.520
 but there is like a feedback loop where people respond

00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:01.600
 to certain parts of you when you put parts of you out there

00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:03.880
 on the internet 'cause we're multi-faceted.

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:05.600
 We're complex creatures.

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:08.560
 And like, I express myself in different ways.

00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:11.780
 And then people react and you kind of start to like think

00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:14.600
 about like, oh, is that the person I am on the internet?

00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:15.960
 Is that who I come off as?

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:17.240
 Oh, do I want to be that person?

00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:18.760
 And then it like influences my thoughts.

00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:19.600
 You probably don't do this.

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:22.360
 You just straight from brain to Twitter

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:23.600
 and you don't think about it.

00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:24.960
 I overanalyze everything.

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:29.000
 So that's why I started this conversation.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:29.840
 What's that?

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:30.840
 - People want people want you to do that.

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:32.680
 They want you to overanalyze it and like--

00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:33.680
 - That's true.

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:37.120
 - You know, police yourself, but it's just not serious.

00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:40.280
 It's just a bunch of words.

00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:42.480
 And like, it's not related to my job.

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:44.800
 It's not like, you're not impacting their job.

00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:46.440
 It's like, there's nothing real.

00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:49.720
 So it's especially weird when people are treated

00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:53.240
 more seriously than their real life relationships.

00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:55.040
 - Yep, yep, yep, yep.

00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:55.880
 - Yeah.

00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:56.720
 - Okay, that's enough about that.

00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:57.720
 That's all I want to say.

00:48:57.720 --> 00:48:58.560
 - Yeah.

00:48:58.560 --> 00:48:59.560
 I don't even know if I said anything.

00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:00.920
 That's all I want to say about it.

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:02.960
 (laughing)

00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:04.280
 I'm like kind of walking on eggshells

00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:05.440
 'cause there's people I really respect.

00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:06.880
 - We all know what you're doing.

00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:07.880
 - Wait, what, really?

00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:09.320
 There's people you respect?

00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:10.160
 - Well, hang on.

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:11.000
 You didn't even finish this sentence.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.360
 - I don't have anyone I respect.

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:13.240
 - You don't respect anybody.

00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:14.880
 Okay, that's fair.

00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:16.000
 I believe that actually.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.640
 There's people I really respect

00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:22.600
 that I think have a stance that's more like,

00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:26.840
 there's no room for negativity on the internet.

00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:27.680
 I don't know.

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:31.120
 That's an exaggerated form of what they would say.

00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:35.080
 But, man, I'm really trying to walk on eggshells here.

00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:38.240
 And there's like, it's stupid.

00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:39.680
 I shouldn't.

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:40.880
 Who listens to this?

00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:42.480
 Is anyone even listening right now?

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:44.720
 (laughing)

00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:51.480
 - Well, I linked that tweet that I posted a while ago

00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:56.400
 where when I was in that manager role for a little bit,

00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:58.600
 there are situations that you'll run into

00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:01.280
 where there's a conflict.

00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:04.920
 And one person, when you look at the conflict on the surface,

00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:07.240
 one person's like totally behaving outside the realm

00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:09.240
 of what's like quote unquote professional.

00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:11.520
 Like they're being negative or they're like,

00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:13.480
 maybe both are kind of outside the range,

00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:16.200
 but like one is clearly like way outside the range.

00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:17.200
 - Yeah.

00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:19.000
 - So people instinct is like,

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.960
 okay, let's try to like find both of them.

00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:22.840
 Find the middle ground for both them.

00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:23.960
 The classic thing.

00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:25.880
 And you interview any other real manager.

00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:27.040
 I would get them in a room.

00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:28.880
 I would get them in a room together and I would

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:30.760
 make them work out their differences.

00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:32.440
 And this is what every manager does.

00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:34.600
 And this to me is equivalent of this like feel goodery.

00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:37.400
 It's like, oh yeah, everyone has a perspective

00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:40.760
 and one person is right and the other person is also right.

00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:42.640
 And there's like some common ground thinking for themselves.

00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:44.720
 And every manager sees this as a role.

00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:46.800
 But again, this is super cowardly

00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:48.400
 'cause what's a manager actually doing?

00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:51.880
 They're protecting their own relationship with both of them.

00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:54.400
 They're like, I don't want other than to be too upset with me.

00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:56.960
 So let me just make sure they both equally win and lose.

00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:57.800
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:00.560
 - And I think a good manager digs deeper

00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:03.120
 and oftentimes they find that the person

00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:05.920
 that's acting extra unreasonably

00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:08.040
 is because they've been pushed really far

00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:10.720
 by the other person who's very good at acting professional

00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:12.800
 but like being extremely annoying.

00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:13.640
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:16.120
 - Like imagine that you have a real problem.

00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:17.000
 Like someone didn't do their job.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.800
 Like you're working on so many other one person

00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:20.160
 didn't do their job.

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:21.840
 But like they're like just responding to you

00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:23.720
 in this like really professional way

00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:25.720
 and like still not doing their job

00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:27.240
 but like being really like professional

00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:28.800
 and like just kind of shifting stuff around.

00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:30.000
 That'll drive you insane

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.960
 if you're someone that actually trying to do stuff

00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:32.800
 gets up done, right?

00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:34.800
 You're gonna start like acting like a crazy person.

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:35.640
 - Yeah.

00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:37.120
 - I would see these situations all the time

00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:40.680
 and I'm like, my actual job is to figure out

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:41.600
 someone is right here.

00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:43.160
 In this situation and oftentimes complex,

00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:45.480
 one person is in the right and that person is in the wrong.

00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:46.800
 Take a side with them

00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:48.520
 and then just like destroy the other person

00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:52.640
 because that's like what will actually

00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:54.160
 make your team more productive.

00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:56.600
 And you as a manager, you're actually risking something there.

00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:59.960
 Like you might be wrong, but like assume you're not.

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:01.840
 One person is gonna be really mad at you.

00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:03.560
 Other people watching you, the other manager,

00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:05.080
 this is also a huge thing with middle managers.

00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:07.000
 Like all the middle managers are watching each other.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:07.840
 They're gonna look at that

00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:10.520
 and be like, they're not gonna think you're bad

00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:12.440
 'cause you didn't like find compromise.

00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:13.600
 But what does a good leader do?

00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:15.000
 That's what a good leader does.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:16.840
 So I feel like a lot of this stuff stems

00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:18.720
 from this type of situation

00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:21.560
 where people are actually just looking out for themselves

00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:22.760
 as opposed to really thinking about

00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:24.480
 what's actually going on here

00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:25.480
 and what's like the right outcome.

00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:27.520
 - Yeah, I can't articulate it like you

00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:28.960
 and I can't put my finger on it.

00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:32.200
 But I have this like internal feeling

00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:34.120
 when people are doing this thing,

00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:36.000
 which is what you're describing this like,

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:39.080
 it looks so good and it looks like from the outside.

00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:41.040
 Like of course, this is the reasonable thing

00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:43.920
 you should be doing on Twitter and replies.

00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:47.240
 It just feels wrong and it just feels so,

00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:49.360
 yeah, self-serving or something.

00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:53.960
 And I just wanna like scream, it's not like I think I'm right.

00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:56.320
 - And that person is driving you crazy, right?

00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:57.920
 Now you're acting like a crazy person.

00:52:57.920 --> 00:52:59.960
 That's what's so insidious about this stuff

00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:01.880
 because it looks positive

00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:05.120
 but is like the most annoying thing in the world.

00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:06.320
 - Yes.

00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:08.560
 And I think like I just wanna say publicly,

00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:10.560
 but I don't think I'm right all the time.

00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:13.440
 Like it doesn't, it's not like I think I'm always right.

00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:15.880
 But like, I don't care.

00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:17.200
 (laughing)

00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:20.320
 I'm gonna say what I think and what I feel on Twitter

00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:22.160
 because what's the point otherwise?

00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:23.440
 And that's fine.

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:25.920
 You can like, you can not like me because of it.

00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:27.000
 I'm not, I don't know.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.000
 I don't wanna just like constantly be like the counter

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:33.220
 to somebody's like the thorn in their side.

00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:34.960
 If that makes sense.

00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:37.760
 I do feel like that's just like a waste of my energy and time.

00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:40.560
 But like when people are being extra annoying in my eyes,

00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:42.480
 I'm probably just gonna like talk a lot about it.

00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:43.880
 And I'm sorry.

00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:44.720
 I'm not sorry.

00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:45.560
 I don't know.

00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:47.200
 (laughing)

00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:50.280
 But yeah, I mean, people, I think people are just very lost.

00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:52.200
 That's the feeling I get when people talk like that.

00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:53.960
 I'm just like, they're just completely lost.

00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:57.480
 Like, I think I say all the time where I feel the purpose

00:53:57.480 --> 00:54:00.440
 of life is just to like, make sense of all of it.

00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:01.640
 And whenever I see people like that,

00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:02.680
 I'm like, they're so confused.

00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:04.440
 I just have no idea what's going on.

00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:06.200
 And like, they're just completely lost

00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:10.040
 and it sucks to live a life where you never really get it, you know?

00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:10.880
 - I don't know if I get it.

00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:11.720
 Do I get it?

00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:12.560
 I don't know if I get it.

00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:13.480
 - Everyone gets it to various degrees.

00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:14.320
 Yeah.

00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:16.120
 - The way you're speaking is so better

00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:18.360
 than the thing you're speaking about, so.

00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:19.200
 - Okay.

00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:20.760
 Still feel pretty lost, but okay.

00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:22.120
 That's another topic for another day.

00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:22.960
 - We're all lost.

00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:24.840
 We just talked earlier about how we can go forwards in time.

00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:26.840
 Like, that's confusing.

00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:27.840
 - That's crazy.

00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:29.120
 Let's go forwards in time.

00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:30.080
 Let's do it.

00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:31.720
 That sounds awesome.

00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:32.880
 - I would love to do that.

00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:35.840
 If I go there's like sleep for 10 years?

00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:36.680
 It is not eight.

00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:38.160
 - Oh, like, 100% free year or whatever.

00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:39.520
 And then like, come back.

00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:40.440
 Why 10?

00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:41.360
 Let's go further.

00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:42.760
 - I mean, you kind of want to check in

00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:45.320
 every X amount of years, just so you don't like overshoot.

00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:47.680
 And like, suddenly you wake up when everyone's gone.

00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:49.240
 Yeah, no humans and just all robots.

00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:50.800
 Like, you don't want that.

00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:51.640
 'Cause you can't go back.

00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:53.000
 There's a whole future on my episode about this.

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.240
 I found it so funny.

00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:56.880
 They invent the time machine, but can only go forward.

00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:58.840
 And they're testing it and they're trying to go forward

00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:01.240
 like two minutes, but they hit the lever too hard

00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:03.960
 and they go forward like a thousand years and like,

00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:04.880
 shit, okay.

00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:09.320
 Let's keep jumping forward until someone invents

00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:10.880
 a backwards time machine.

00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:14.480
 And they're like, they're like witnessing all this crazy stuff.

00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:16.760
 And they finally, finally like some other civilization

00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:19.800
 emerges and they seem like sophisticated and intelligent.

00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:21.800
 They're like, okay, it's going to take us 100 years,

00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:25.480
 come back in 100 years, but then they get wiped out too

00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:26.720
 by some stupid thing.

00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:29.400
 And then it was like, all right, we're screwed.

00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:31.240
 They just like push the lever all the way.

00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:35.400
 And then it just goes to the end of like entropy,

00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:38.400
 like everything just completely dissolves.

00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:40.760
 And then it reboots and starts over from the beginning.

00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:42.040
 Oh, cool.

00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:44.040
 Now we can get back to where we were.

00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:45.040
 And they overshoot it again.

00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:47.640
 And then they let me hit you and I try to kill Hitler

00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:49.040
 on the way as a bunch of funny stuff.

00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:53.800
 But I got to watch that show.

00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:55.400
 I mean, I don't have any time to invest.

00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:58.640
 But yeah, it's not like that's that's a funny concept

00:55:58.640 --> 00:55:59.480
 because I think it's true.

00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:01.760
 I think you could invent a way to go forward,

00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:04.960
 but you're stuck if you overshoot something, you know?

00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:05.800
 Yeah.

00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:07.680
 Yeah, this was, this was, you also said something

00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:09.200
 that reminded me of a tweet I just saw,

00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:12.000
 which is like some person, I don't know anything about them

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.600
 or whether they're credible, but they've made some tweet

00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:18.160
 about like 70% sure AI is going to kill us all.

00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:19.000
 And they were serious.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.360
 Like it was like a sincere post.

00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:24.520
 Adam, the person that posted that is that birthday,

00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:26.320
 orgy birthday gang bang girl.

00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:29.040
 I'm sorry, what am I supposed to have context

00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:29.880
 for what birthday?

00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:31.400
 I told you about this whole thing

00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:34.880
 in like a couple, like a bunch of episodes ago.

00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:36.080
 Oh, really?

00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:38.400
 About a birthday orgy girl?

00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:41.720
 This is that woman that like

00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:46.000
 is really into like quote unquote sex research

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:49.360
 and has like and does all this like really crazy stuff

00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:51.120
 related to sex and like documents it

00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:55.080
 in this like hyper like quantitative way.

00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:57.600
 I'm just really like kind of concerned at this moment

00:56:57.600 --> 00:56:58.760
 that I don't remember this.

00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:02.000
 I feel like it's such a distinct and like notable thing

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:05.080
 to forget, but I literally don't remember this.

00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:06.880
 Okay, let's move on from that point.

00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:11.320
 But for the record, I think,

00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:14.400
 and we talked a little bit while you were in Miami actually,

00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:15.660
 the whole scientism thing.

00:57:15.660 --> 00:57:17.700
 Yeah, yeah.

00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:18.760
 I do not like her.

00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:20.720
 And I think she's like a fake intellectual.

00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:21.640
 Like I think that's exactly.

00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:22.480
 Okay.

00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:23.600
 So you knew who this person was.

00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:25.720
 And so when I saw our post that I was like,

00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:26.880
 that's what I expect.

00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:31.040
 And like to be clear, I wasn't like influenced

00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:33.760
 by this tweet like, oh God, we're all gonna die.

00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:35.680
 I just saw that tweet.

00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:39.880
 And then you just said something about moving too far

00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:41.000
 in the future and it's all robots.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.360
 And I was like, oh, hey, that's what that person's saying.

00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:46.760
 They were saying that they strongly believe that's a point

00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:48.680
 where they're like shifting how they live their life

00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:52.080
 so that they are investing in saving risks.

00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:53.960
 They're trying to like take more risks,

00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:56.160
 worried about long-term health less.

00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:57.840
 Yeah, yeah, which is fine.

00:57:57.840 --> 00:58:02.840
 But I just, that's like really crazy to me, I don't know.

00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:06.200
 Yeah, that's nuts.

00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:08.680
 It's to be that certain of it.

00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:13.680
 I also just don't see the like rational concern

00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:15.560
 over AI right now.

00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:17.120
 Like I just don't see it.

00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:20.240
 I don't see what they would see that they'd be like,

00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:23.560
 look at these LLMs, we're doomed, I don't know.

00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:25.800
 I'm not like trying to do the other side of the joke

00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:27.640
 where it's like, these things are so stupid.

00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:30.240
 I just don't think like this is gonna lead to like robots

00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:31.800
 taking over, I don't know.

00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:35.200
 Yeah, it's actually really crazy because having,

00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:37.680
 it's so hard man, like just understanding all this stuff

00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:41.720
 is just so hard because we all went to the crypto thing

00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:44.600
 and like, we saw people talk like this

00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:48.360
 where they were so sure of some like crazy shift

00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:49.360
 that was gonna happen.

00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:52.920
 And for very specific reasons,

00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:56.640
 they were like misguided about that or like it didn't.

00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:58.240
 Yeah, I think a lot of people take that

00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:00.000
 and it's kind of blanket apply to anything new.

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.680
 They're like, if there's any new and people are excited

00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:04.440
 about it, it's probably wrong, which is not right.

00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:06.480
 But also probably they are wrong.

00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:08.200
 So you guys have to figure out like exactly why they are.

00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:10.000
 So it's just like, it's a lot.

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:11.280
 And it's kind of what I was saying.

00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:13.360
 When I go to build a crud app, I'm like, this is easy.

00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:15.920
 Like, you know, so much ease and a lot of stuff

00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:16.840
 that I'm trying to think about.

00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:19.680
 That's why I feel like I have a hard time commenting

00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:22.440
 on any of it because I feel like these people are surely

00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:25.120
 like really in the weeds and doing research, right?

00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:27.040
 Like I'm just busy making crud apps over here.

00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:28.680
 And it's like, I haven't had time to think about any of this

00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:30.920
 very hard, but it just seems ridiculous

00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:32.320
 that people take strong stances

00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:33.800
 on either side of the argument.

00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:36.920
 Like we should accelerate or decelerate or whatever.

00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:40.640
 I could just, I assume these people are doing like

00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:42.720
 real research and they have real thoughts

00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:44.080
 with capital letters.

00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:47.000
 But then I'm like, I don't know, people are kind of stupid.

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:47.880
 And like, maybe not.

00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:49.560
 Maybe it's just as simple as it seems.

00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:50.960
 - When it comes to predicting the future,

00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:54.800
 experts do not do better than the average person.

00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:57.280
 - Okay, so I'm an average person and I just predict.

00:59:57.280 --> 00:59:59.440
 - There's more, there's more confident in their predictions.

00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:01.880
 - Yeah, do you start to feel like you're taking crazy pills

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:04.640
 when like every big company has jumped so hard

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:06.080
 into the AI thing?

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:07.400
 Like that didn't happen with crypto.

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:10.280
 They've like, they've gone all, like all their events

01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:12.480
 are just basically like AI.

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:14.600
 I mean, there's the Google thing, meme,

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:16.320
 like all the times people said AI.

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:18.120
 But like AWS became an AI company.

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:19.400
 Like all these things are happening

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:21.960
 where it's like the biggest companies in the world

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:24.280
 have like gone so hard.

01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:26.000
 And it just almost seems like a meme.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.480
 Like it's hilarious to me that they've gone so hard

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:29.800
 to see on this path.

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:33.160
 I don't know, maybe I'm just, I'm too busy

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:35.920
 in the muck of inconsequential things

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:37.120
 to see the big picture or something.

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:37.960
 I don't know.

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:39.920
 - I think there's, again, just both sides.

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:43.320
 Like yes, there is really something there to align yourself

01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:44.920
 with and it makes sense why they're doing that.

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:46.440
 But at the same time, like I just,

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:48.520
 some of this earlier today,

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:50.680
 like you think about like serious stuff in the world,

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:53.720
 like political conflicts, like wars and there's people

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:56.360
 that stay their job is like think about that and manage it.

01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:57.200
 - Yeah.

01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:59.760
 - And at some point you get to an age where you're like,

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:01.000
 'cause your whole life, you're like,

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.240
 those are grownups and like I'm like not a grownup.

01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:05.120
 And those are grownups doing like the grownup things.

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:06.640
 But then eventually you realize like.

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:08.200
 - Yeah, this is exactly the feeling.

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:09.400
 - They're actually the same as you.

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:11.800
 And probably a lot of them are stupid

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:14.800
 or like less capable or less, less competent.

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:15.640
 And it's just random.

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:16.800
 The fact that they're working on that

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:19.000
 and you're working on this is just an entirely random thing.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.480
 And it's really weird to like re-wire your minds

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:24.640
 'cause like it really just feels like they're in charge

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:25.480
 and I'm like a kid.

01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:26.320
 - Yeah.

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:27.920
 - And it's hard to realize like they're actually just like you

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:29.680
 and they wake up and have the same thoughts

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:32.640
 and it's actually the exact same person.

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:33.600
 It's like a different species

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:35.000
 or like a completely different experience.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.360
 So I think in corporate situations it's actually even worse

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:42.680
 'cause I think that people that run these bigger companies

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:45.560
 are actually extremely likely to be less competent

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:49.080
 than you extremely likely to like have less sense

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.520
 of what's actually going on.

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:53.880
 And they're in an environment where like even me

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:56.240
 or you entering that environment would be much worse.

01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:59.520
 So it's like, just these companies are so big and successful

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:04.120
 you like start to feel like the individuals there reflect that

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:07.000
 but they don't really like they're just like you and me

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.080
 and they're in a worse situation.

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:11.400
 So yeah, these companies do stuff like that all the time

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:13.080
 and it doesn't make sense.

01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:17.160
 Did you watch the Google I/O?

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:18.360
 I don't know if you watched it

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:21.360
 but you saw like the Google I/O stuff, right?

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:24.240
 - I've just, I've literally the two things I've seen

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:26.440
 and I haven't listened to the audio of the guy.

01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:28.240
 I guess these are, is he a DJ?

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:29.080
 Who is he?

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:30.680
 I don't know, the guy running around.

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.760
 I've been just following him for 10 years.

01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:35.000
 Like it's my usual 10 years but for real it's different.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.400
 - You have been following for 10 years?

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:39.000
 Oh, is he like a legitimate person?

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.760
 - Yeah, he's in New York and he's like a,

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:44.560
 okay, I wish to go ahead and pronounce his last name.

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:46.720
 It's like Mark Rebecca or something like that.

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:48.120
 - Okay.

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:51.960
 - So I saw him pop up, I don't know, like,

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:53.520
 I don't remember when, like early on

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.680
 he wasn't that big 'cause he would make these videos

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:57.260
 where he would just be in his like,

01:02:57.260 --> 01:03:00.400
 jiddy Brooklyn apartment and he'd like,

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:02.480
 start from nothing like burp into a microphone

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:04.320
 and like turn that into like a whole song

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:06.040
 and just be going nuts and going crazy

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:08.160
 and like, and he like, what, he like,

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.320
 got so popular, went super viral.

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:15.000
 But there is a video of him from when he was a kid

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
 where this news crew, you know,

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.840
 back when like iPhones were such a big deal

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:20.160
 and there'd be like lines around the store

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:21.480
 when an iPhone came out?

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:24.760
 - Yeah, yeah. There's a video of a news crew filming him

01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:27.800
 and he's like first in line of the iPhone store

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:32.000
 and someone that's trying to buy like 10 iPhones

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.680
 pays him a bunch of money to take a spot, okay?

01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:36.520
 - Okay.

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:39.800
 - And she takes a spot and he goes to the back line

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:42.280
 and just waits and then the store is like,

01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:43.440
 limit one per person.

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:48.160
 So he sold the spot and got a free iPhone.

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:50.560
 This like went like viral for back in the day, you know,

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:52.160
 when like the local news covers it

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:53.920
 and like all the new shows are playing it.

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:55.240
 Yeah. And then he like, you know,

01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:58.600
 then became this random like music producer DJ person

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:00.200
 and now he's like doing the Google I/O event.

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:02.880
 It's a, what a trajectory of his life.

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:05.680
 - So I've seen him taking off a robe

01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:07.080
 and like, having seen the robe on.

01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:07.920
 - He's super funny.

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:09.160
 - That's what I've seen.

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:10.720
 And then I've seen with audio,

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:13.000
 I've seen the, all the times I said AI

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.080
 and I thought that was funny.

01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:15.520
 That's all I've seen in Google I/O.

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:16.360
 I just don't care.

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:19.520
 - So something like, I had it playing on the background

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:21.120
 and I'm about to talk about this very dramatically.

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:22.120
 Prepare yourself.

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:24.240
 It's my favorite.

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:27.880
 It like, I felt like something like break in my like soul.

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:29.040
 Like listening to this.

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:34.880
 Because it is, it is just this big event

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:37.000
 that you know that they spent millions on.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.240
 You know they've been planning it for months

01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:42.720
 and it is just corporate dork after corporate dork

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:45.720
 just talking about the least inspiring thing ever.

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:47.080
 And the moment where my soul,

01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:49.240
 I could feel my soul break was

01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:51.400
 there was this person giving their thing

01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:54.320
 and it was like really boring, not engaging, not exciting.

01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:55.920
 And she ends it with.

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:56.760
 Oh, and one more thing.

01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:59.400
 We're increasing context window to two million.

01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:03.560
 And I realized that's the Steve Jobs thing.

01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:05.640
 She's just doing the, oh yeah.

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:06.480
 And one more thing.

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:08.160
 And think about like when he first did it.

01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:11.120
 Like so innovative, the level of showmanship,

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:12.440
 the delivery of the drama.

01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:13.760
 Like so well done.

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:17.640
 Like it's just pinnacle of whatever that is.

01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:18.960
 And she just followed some template

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:21.080
 and she just threw his thing in there at the end.

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:22.840
 And I'm just like, this like really hurt me

01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:23.680
 for some reason.

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:25.920
 I'm just like, I cannot believe that.

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:27.200
 They're just following this template

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:29.200
 that I'm not even thinking about what they're doing.

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:33.600
 Like, they're copying this thing that I came in articulated

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:34.880
 just like, it's just so exciting.

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:37.760
 - There's just a few bright spots in humanity.

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:40.960
 You realize how few like people get it

01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:44.720
 and are actually capable of like wowing you

01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:46.440
 or like inspiring you.

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:47.960
 And then there's a whole bunch of people

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:50.080
 just following those leads.

01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:52.400
 - And that's Google.

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:55.160
 - Copying it is one thing but copying it to a degree

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:57.400
 where it's clear you don't even understand

01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:59.080
 why it's worth copying it in the first place.

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:01.560
 That's just like, it's brutal.

01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:03.280
 - That whole thing, like the fact that Google

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:04.920
 even has a conference, the whole thing just feels

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:07.320
 like a giant joke to me because at the end of the day,

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:08.720
 it's like the only thing that matters at Google

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:10.760
 is they're gonna keep selling ads on search results pages

01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:13.520
 until that goes away, until the heat depth of the universe

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:15.600
 or advertising is no longer viable.

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:17.560
 Everything else they talk about, who cares?

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:18.400
 It doesn't matter.

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:19.520
 It literally doesn't matter.

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:21.720
 So they can get up there and talk about whatever they want.

01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:22.720
 It doesn't matter.

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:23.640
 Like they're gonna sell ads

01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:25.720
 and they're gonna kill everything else they ever do.

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:27.280
 It's just, they're just a giant joke.

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:29.480
 - And what's so funny to me is they're like, you know,

01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:32.640
 the internet company, like the prototypical internet company

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:35.000
 but they don't operate like they're in an internet company

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:35.840
 at all.

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:40.360
 Like the thing where OpenAI put together an event

01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:42.040
 that happened the day before, you know,

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:43.720
 they timed that on purpose.

01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:48.120
 The event probably took them maybe a week to put together

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:51.120
 and they posted it like Sam Altman was just recording it

01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:52.960
 on this phone in front of it.

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:56.320
 And they totally upstayed just much bigger thing.

01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:58.760
 Like forget the fact that maybe the product was actually

01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:01.120
 better even if you take that out of the picture.

01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:04.040
 We all saw a bunch of stuff and then the next day

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:06.440
 we saw Google show the same stuff in our worst way.

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:09.680
 So way more nimble, way less, like just,

01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:11.720
 they're thinking like, you know, it's the internet.

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:15.400
 Like you don't need to, like you have so much leverage

01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:16.480
 if you do things in a certain way.

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:18.600
 Like you can just completely crush someone with way more

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:19.840
 money to spend on this stuff.

01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:22.760
 And you need, I was like, go need to fire every single person.

01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:24.120
 Like they don't understand that they should not

01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:24.960
 be in that role.

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:29.680
 - But we got to talk about the OpenAI event as well.

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:30.520
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:31.360
 I was gonna ask you about that.

01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:32.520
 - So the only thing I want to talk about,

01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:35.120
 and we can talk about actual stuff,

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:36.800
 but the only thing I want to talk about

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:40.320
 is this feeling I had when I saw this tweet from,

01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:42.360
 I don't know who it is, maybe you know this woman

01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:45.840
 from some orgies or something, but this woman tweeted

01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:49.120
 that it was like a quote tweet of one of the demos

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:52.640
 that this nerd OpenAI guy with this goofy grin

01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:54.160
 is like doing the demo.

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:55.880
 And she's just quote tweeting to say like,

01:07:55.880 --> 01:08:00.880
 why is the voice so like turned on sounding or whatever.

01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:03.440
 Like hyper sexualized or whatever.

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:05.040
 Like why is this woman?

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:06.840
 It sounds like, I think the tweet was like,

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:10.560
 sounds like a woman invented by men.

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:11.560
 - Yeah.

01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:13.400
 - Which is, I don't know, there's probably some truth in it.

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:15.920
 But then I realized like looking at that tweet

01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:18.880
 through the replies, I hate both sides

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:20.120
 of men's responses to it.

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:21.880
 Like literally hate both of them.

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:24.400
 I hate the people, the guys who are like,

01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:27.880
 oh, grow up women, like just try to make everything about you.

01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:29.680
 I hate those guys, they sound like assholes.

01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:31.400
 And then I hate the guys that are like,

01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:32.840
 I know, isn't it terrible?

01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:35.880
 Like I get it, I'm with you, I hate both of them.

01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:37.080
 I just hate them.

01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:39.800
 I just, I think the only good response from a man

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:41.800
 when you see that tweet is literally don't respond.

01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:42.720
 Just don't respond.

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:44.040
 That's it, that's the only good response.

01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:44.880
 Just don't.

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:47.600
 (both laughing)

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:49.680
 Sorry, that's the only thought I had about open AI.

01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:50.840
 - That's so good.

01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:52.760
 Yeah, it's a, it's a thing.

01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:53.680
 Me and Liz were talking about this.

01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:54.960
 I think Paul Graham talked about this,

01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:58.560
 that if you are truly an independent thinker,

01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:00.920
 sometimes you will find yourself

01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:02.720
 on the side of people you hate.

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:06.840
 Right, like, oh man, I'm on, I believe in this,

01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:09.440
 but like, ah, this other guy also believes in it.

01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:11.360
 You should find yourself in situations like that.

01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:12.560
 And you should find yourself in situations

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:14.480
 where you just hate both sides.

01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:15.840
 If you're in never in those situations,

01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:18.160
 like you're not actually really thinking.

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:22.440
 But yeah, I did see them and that was funny.

01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:24.520
 What did you think about the,

01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:27.360
 you saw the video of the actual demo,

01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:28.320
 like the way it was talking?

01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:29.640
 Did you have any thoughts about that?

01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:30.520
 - I don't know, I guess that thought

01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:32.040
 it could already do all that stuff.

01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:34.760
 - Is there something that I haven't seen

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:36.800
 probably as much as you?

01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:39.040
 I have played with, like it's available, right?

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:41.920
 The open AI or the chat GPT app, like.

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:43.320
 - Okay, so there was a multi-model stuff.

01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:44.560
 There's like a new model.

01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:45.400
 - It could already take,

01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:47.280
 it could already describe images to you.

01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:48.120
 - Yeah, but I think it was like,

01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:50.560
 you can kind of, you can like do video now also.

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:51.480
 - Oh, this video.

01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:52.840
 - And you can, that's a distinction.

01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:54.920
 - It's more fluid and seamless basically.

01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:57.280
 And the other thing was like all the audio generation

01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:59.520
 improvements they did where like it can do

01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:00.360
 - Oh, I did hear.

01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:02.280
 - But if you have friends and emotions,

01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:03.120
 you can tell do a sing song voice,

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:03.960
 you can like sing.

01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:04.800
 - It was singing.

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:05.640
 - Yeah, I heard that.

01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:06.960
 - You can say do a story in like a robotic voice.

01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:08.120
 You can do anything and it basically does it,

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:09.680
 which was extremely cool.

01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:11.360
 And I thought it was like a really cool demo.

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:12.920
 And I'm like, if you're a kid,

01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:14.280
 like this is probably so fun.

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:15.320
 If you're, you know, as an adult,

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:16.160
 if you're going to play with it,

01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:18.960
 like it's, it's really interesting.

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:23.440
 I have this weird feeling where what I liked

01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:27.360
 about chat GPT is that it was not like a human

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:29.120
 or humans have feelings and emotions.

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:30.760
 And like there's a whole layer of communicating

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:32.400
 with the human properly that you need to do

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:35.120
 to like work around these things.

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:35.960
 - Yeah, yeah.

01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:40.280
 - And I feel like with this voice thing for like serious work,

01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:42.200
 they're making it more like a human,

01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:44.000
 but in ways that I find less efficient,

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.320
 like I don't need it to be like,

01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:49.160
 oh, you know, like say things like that,

01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:52.120
 like say, um, or like laugh in between things or like,

01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:52.960
 - Yeah.

01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:54.280
 - It's more natural for sure.

01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:56.560
 And then in certain contexts, that's great.

01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:59.340
 But, but it's kind of a thing we didn't need to bring over

01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:00.180
 to the, yeah.

01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:01.960
 - If I'm like trying to tap into a super intelligence,

01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:04.640
 like, yeah, I don't want that stuff, you know?

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:05.480
 - Yeah, yeah.

01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:07.560
 No, I get that.

01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:09.360
 Yeah, I get why people want it.

01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:12.880
 And I get why, like, we don't need it as well.

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:13.720
 - Yeah.

01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:14.560
 Yeah.

01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:15.400
 But people were going crazy with the,

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:17.080
 cause everybody wouldn't have heard.

01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:18.680
 - Yeah, I've never seen her.

01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:19.880
 - I mean, it's a really good movie.

01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:20.960
 - It's extremely good.

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:21.800
 - Okay.

01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:22.640
 - Yeah.

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:23.480
 - I'll put it on the list.

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:24.800
 - I think maybe that's the next one I'll watch.

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:28.280
 I'm not gonna watch Dune 2, but then I'll watch her.

01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:30.360
 - Yeah, Dune 2's out now.

01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:34.440
 - I know, so I've, it's been out, quote unquote,

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:36.800
 it's been out for weeks now,

01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:38.960
 but in varying degrees of quality.

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:41.960
 So, there was like an early version of it

01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:44.800
 that was like 3.1 audio or whatever.

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:48.080
 And then when it came out on streaming, we got the 5.1.

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:49.740
 Now we're up to the 7.1 tree.

01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:51.240
 - Oh, there we go, there we go.

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:52.080
 - Yeah.

01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:52.920
 - Now you need that for that movie.

01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:55.080
 - What, the audio in that movie is better than anything.

01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:55.920
 I've ever heard.

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:57.600
 - I know, and the first one was so good.

01:11:57.600 --> 01:11:59.480
 It was like how I tested my system.

01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:00.300
 - Yeah.

01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:02.840
 - And I just can't wait for, I wasn't gonna watch it

01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:04.920
 until it was the best possible audio experience.

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:05.760
 - No, definitely not before.

01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:07.680
 - Now I can't watch it 'cause my four year old

01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:09.800
 has decided he wants to sleep on the couch

01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:11.560
 in our living room and it's two,

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:13.120
 like the audio would get to him.

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.400
 Like I would wake him up in the morning.

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:16.280
 I watch movies before they wake up.

01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:17.680
 Like that's my time for like,

01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:19.280
 if I'm gonna do it on a Saturday morning,

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:21.480
 I go in there at like 4.30 and I watch a movie

01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:22.880
 before everybody is out of bed.

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:24.840
 Like that's how I can watch a movie.

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:26.360
 I can't do it 'cause he's not in his room.

01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:29.160
 It's a stamp machine, he's in the living room and it's new.

01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:30.160
 - Oh my God.

01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:31.080
 - It's a whole thing.

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:31.920
 We're working on it.

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:33.080
 - Just lock him in your room, in his room.

01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:34.720
 - Yeah, it's not that easy.

01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:35.560
 It's not.

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:37.160
 - It's just unfortunately.

01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:38.600
 - It's just like sorry.

01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:40.640
 Oh yeah, I forget, you're good at parenting advice.

01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:42.000
 (laughing)

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.760
 - 'Cause you have a dog, it's Zuko's birthday today.

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:45.600
 - Is it really?

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:46.440
 - Yeah.

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:47.640
 - Happy birthday, Zuko, that's amazing.

01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:51.120
 - Turning to, he had his friend Kamaru yesterday

01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:52.500
 and they played for four hours.

01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:55.600
 - I saw a picture, four hours of different butts.

01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:56.760
 That's what that was.

01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:57.760
 - They were around wrestling.

01:12:57.760 --> 01:12:59.120
 There was even some bleeding going on.

01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:00.040
 The other dog bit its own time.

01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:00.880
 - Bleeding?

01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:01.720
 - Yeah.

01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:04.480
 - Oh, he bit his own tongue.

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:07.440
 - Yeah, it was like bled all over my deck area.

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:08.280
 - Oh no.

01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:10.960
 - But then she was like fine, like two minutes after.

01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:13.840
 I just like, the wound just like sealed itself.

01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:16.160
 The dogs heal so fast, it's insane.

01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:18.480
 - So there's dog healing, but then also just like

01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:20.440
 inside of your mouth, what's the deal with that?

01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:21.880
 Like how does it just heal so fast?

01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:23.440
 'Cause you bite your lip or whatever and it's bleeding

01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:25.960
 and then like three minutes later, it's not.

01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:26.960
 But it's all wet in there?

01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:28.080
 Like how does it even stop?

01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:28.920
 I don't understand it.

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:29.920
 - I don't know.

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:31.360
 So that was his birthday.

01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:33.400
 He had to play for four hours and he was dead.

01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:34.240
 - Four hours.

01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:35.320
 - And today we're gonna go to the pet store

01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:37.560
 and we let him like, just walk around by himself.

01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:39.280
 - Choose any toy he wants.

01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:40.120
 - Yeah.

01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:43.120
 - Last year he picked a giant sheep,

01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:45.040
 like a giant stuffed sheep.

01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:45.880
 But we'll see what happens this year.

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:46.720
 - Oh, a sheep.

01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:48.000
 I thought he said a giant sheep

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.600
 and I was waiting for the last word.

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:50.600
 - I don't know.

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:51.600
 - A giant sheep.

01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:52.600
 - It wasn't sheep.

01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:53.600
 (laughing)

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:54.600
 - Okay.

01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:55.600
 - Yeah.

01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:56.600
 - He picked a giant sheep.

01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:57.760
 I can't believe I didn't see the giant sheep

01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:58.760
 when I was in Miami.

01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:00.520
 - No, no, he destroyed it very quickly.

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:01.520
 - Oh, okay.

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:02.520
 (laughing)

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:03.520
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:05.040
 - That's so funny.

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:08.480
 I thought you were gonna say, when you said sheep,

01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:11.240
 it just reminded me of like, when you take kids

01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:14.600
 to like pick something out, like I take them to the place

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:16.560
 where there's a bunch of legosets and stuff.

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:18.200
 And it's like, you could choose anything

01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:22.240
 you're gonna choose to like $25 like 300 piece legoset.

01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:25.040
 Like, look at this giant castle, come on now.

01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:27.320
 Like, no, they're stuck on this suitable set

01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:28.320
 and they want it.

01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:29.320
 Like, okay.

01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:30.400
 - Yeah, you know, having a dog and having a kid

01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:31.400
 exactly the same.

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:32.400
 - Exactly the same.

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:33.800
 Yeah, we basically live the same life.

01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:38.120
 - Tell your kid to sit and then tell him to come

01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:40.680
 and then more him to his room and then close the door

01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:43.400
 behind and then just watch your movie.

01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:44.400
 (laughing)

01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:46.720
 Go to sleep and then you come back and get him

01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:48.680
 and be happy to see you and get him a little treat.

01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:50.760
 - It's so funny because I know there's like parents

01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:52.640
 that are triggered right now about me just saying

01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:54.000
 that little bit I said, but like,

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.440
 why wouldn't you just make them sleep in the room?

01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:56.720
 Like, there's a lot of context here.

01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:57.640
 Just, you don't understand.

01:14:57.640 --> 01:14:59.640
 Just like Dax doesn't understand.

01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:00.480
 You don't understand.

01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:02.280
 - No, I do understand.

01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:03.120
 - You do.

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:05.160
 I love it.

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:06.960
 That's another thing where I think I hate both sides.

01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:09.360
 I hate the people who are like on your side

01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:10.200
 and the other side.

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:11.280
 Oh, I just hate both of it.

01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:12.120
 No, no.

01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:12.960
 (laughing)

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:15.000
 I'm an independent thinker, you know?

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:15.840
 - Oh, I see.

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:16.680
 - Okay, hang on.

01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:20.000
 But before we get off, at some point in a previous episode,

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.080
 you told me you're gonna rebuild your house somewhere else.

01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:24.520
 And we're like, you really talked about it?

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:27.440
 And I'm like, why do you have to go that far?

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:28.680
 Like, I don't understand.

01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:30.680
 Like, why do you have to rebuild your exact house?

01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:33.440
 - Well, okay.

01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:36.560
 So, I mean, I've told you, like, we moved to Florida.

01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:37.560
 Like, we did that.

01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:38.400
 - I understand the whole journey

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:40.760
 and I understand how you're really happy with your house now.

01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:43.280
 - Okay, but what do you not understand?

01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:45.960
 - You don't think it's weird that you--

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:46.800
 - That's the whole thing.

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:48.520
 - If you're gonna build a second house,

01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:49.720
 if you're gonna go through that work

01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:50.800
 and that costs and everything,

01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:54.160
 that you're just gonna build an identical house, like--

01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:55.000
 - So you're saying, like,

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.480
 why wouldn't you build a different house?

01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:58.080
 - Why wouldn't you build a different house?

01:15:58.080 --> 01:15:59.680
 Isn't there, like, a half step you can do

01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:03.280
 where you just, like, rent a place for some part of the year

01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:04.120
 and then go back?

01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:06.320
 - Okay, yeah, I understand what I was saying.

01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:07.680
 - Yeah, you took it a little too, literally.

01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:09.880
 'Cause I don't know that we're actually gonna do

01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:10.800
 the building of the other house.

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:13.000
 - Okay, we are gonna probably spend our--

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.800
 - Yeah, it's an idea that we picked around.

01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:16.920
 It removes some downsides.

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:19.240
 We are probably gonna spend, just for what it's worth,

01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:21.440
 winter in South Florida, this coming winter.

01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:23.600
 Like, we're not gonna spend this coming winter in Missouri.

01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:27.280
 We're gonna Airbnb something for like two, three months,

01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:28.620
 knowing we can come back to our house.

01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:31.360
 It's not as traumatic 'cause we can come back home.

01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:32.800
 So we are gonna do that this winter.

01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:35.400
 And then, long term, it's just like,

01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:37.400
 we love this situation.

01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:39.280
 We don't wanna move our kids,

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:42.240
 but it almost opens up an avenue where we could move our kids

01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:43.720
 because it's the same house.

01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:47.160
 And it would feel like not that much changed.

01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:49.000
 Like, they don't have that many ties

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.800
 to this location other than this house.

01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:53.880
 So if we just built the same house,

01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:55.360
 we can kind of like circumvent.

01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:57.520
 It's like a life hack or something.

01:16:57.520 --> 01:16:59.120
 - I'm trying to understand this though,

01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:02.040
 because I understand a house that you don't like

01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:03.160
 and it's uncomfortable for your family

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:06.360
 and everyone's kind of like, you know, on edge because of that.

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:09.760
 But the part that's confusing me

01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:12.440
 is why did it have to be like a trick

01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:15.120
 where they think they're in the same exact house?

01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:18.440
 Why can't it also be a comfortable house that, you know,

01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:20.200
 isn't like a clone?

01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:21.840
 - It's just, it's the familiarity.

01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:25.200
 Like, I would feel it if it were a nice house,

01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:28.480
 but it's a different house, then everything is uprooted.

01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:31.480
 It's like, everything is different

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:33.760
 and you feel that day to day.

01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:34.880
 If it were the same house--

01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:36.880
 - But then what about the furniture in the house?

01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:39.080
 It's like, is that gonna also match?

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:40.280
 - I mean, it would have to, yeah.

01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:42.680
 - This is like really weird.

01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:44.680
 I believe you have an explanation for it,

01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:47.560
 but like you're not giving me enough that--

01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:48.400
 - Okay.

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:49.600
 - This starts to make any amount of sense.

01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:51.800
 - I mean, but you get the mechanism, right?

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:53.680
 Like the mechanism here is,

01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:57.400
 if we had this exact environment in another place,

01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:59.320
 our family probably wouldn't even notice,

01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:00.760
 because we don't leave that much.

01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:05.760
 - Why is the goal to like, not notice that you've changed?

01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:09.320
 - It's like, I imagine kids walking around

01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:11.040
 and they look and they're like,

01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:13.680
 they realize that like, one piece of furniture

01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:14.800
 is a slightly different angle.

01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:17.920
 And then they're like, oh my God, I'm like somewhere else.

01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:19.960
 And like the whole like, like something shatters

01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:21.040
 and they just like explode.

01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:24.240
 - Think about the other extreme, like military kids,

01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:25.760
 kids that move around constantly.

01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:26.600
 - Yeah, no, I get that.

01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:27.880
 - That like shapes them.

01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:31.320
 It like, it affects their well-being, right?

01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:33.360
 Or maybe not, maybe in positive ways too, but like,

01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:36.080
 it defines-- - Right, it's a type of person

01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:37.240
 and life that you have, yeah.

01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:39.760
 - And we are on the far end of that other side

01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:43.560
 of the spectrum where, oh, my four-year-old especially

01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:45.640
 is very sensitive to change.

01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:46.480
 - I see.

01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:49.440
 - Oh, there's an example, I'm blanking,

01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:51.960
 just in the last week, there's an example

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:54.560
 of something that changed ever so slightly

01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:57.080
 and it was days of pain.

01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:58.960
 Like I'm not kidding you when I say like--

01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:00.160
 - I see, okay.

01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:02.480
 - So there's a name, I hate to even throw this out there

01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:05.880
 because I feel like the boomers that listen to us,

01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:07.440
 of which I'm sure there are many,

01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:09.600
 are gonna be like, blah, whatever.

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:11.320
 Like you're making up terms.

01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:13.040
 It's called pathological demand avoidance

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:15.280
 and it's a psychological condition in children.

01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:17.760
 They think, I'm still very new science,

01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:22.760
 but like our kid has a very extreme neurological thing.

01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:25.520
 It's about like regulating your nervous system.

01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:27.760
 Basically he's in fight or flight all the time.

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:30.520
 Like constantly feels like he's out of control

01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:32.600
 and he can't cope.

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:35.840
 So other people might say that doesn't exist,

01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:39.120
 whatever, it exists, believe me.

01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:43.320
 I've raised two children and the first one was not like this.

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:45.240
 Our nine year old was four once.

01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:47.840
 - This is funny 'cause this is actually exactly

01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:48.680
 like having a dog.

01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:49.520
 - Oh, maybe.

01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:50.360
 - Yeah.

01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:52.440
 - Like any very sensitive to their environment.

01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:54.040
 - Yeah, because dogs have no ability

01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:56.240
 to predict if they don't know what's gonna happen.

01:19:56.240 --> 01:19:58.560
 Now you can't tell them later we're gonna do this.

01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:00.840
 So the always way they have stability

01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:04.000
 is knowing exactly how every single day is gonna work

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.080
 that they know in the morning this happens

01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:06.800
 and knowing that this happens during this time this happens.

01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:09.520
 And if you take, if you have like variability to that,

01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:11.280
 like their behavior changes

01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:13.160
 'cause they just can't deal with what's gonna happen.

01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:16.720
 So as a dog owner, I totally get it.

01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:18.600
 - You totally understand, I'm so glad.

01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:21.400
 We were all like, okay, I got it.

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:24.160
 Because, so without that context,

01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:26.640
 you understand what you were describing sounds

01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:29.360
 like really, I think you would take for granted

01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:31.800
 that like shifts is gonna be a big deal.

01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:32.960
 - I didn't see it.

01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:34.880
 I now see the bizarreness.

01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:37.400
 Yeah, it's so, I'm so in the thick of it.

01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:41.920
 And for years now, like, for a year, maybe two years,

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:45.480
 that it's just so normal to me to think that way.

01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:47.000
 I didn't even see it from the outside.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.040
 Now I get that I sound like a crazy person.

01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:51.920
 - Well, yeah, to me, it seems like some like sci-fi situation

01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:55.160
 or like some kind of like sci-fi/horror situation

01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:57.080
 where like-- - Like a black mirror episode.

01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:59.040
 - Yeah, they're in some kind of simulation

01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:01.200
 and like, then they realize it's changed and it's like,

01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:03.400
 you know, it's just-- - Yeah, I see it now.

01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:05.360
 I see it, it's not normal.

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:07.320
 Our life is not normal, is what I would say.

01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:10.320
 - Do you think he'll be okay just going?

01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:11.600
 Like, you guys are playing this winner?

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:12.600
 Is that gonna be like--

01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:13.640
 - Oh, we have no idea.

01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:15.160
 We literally can't take him to Kansas.

01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:17.400
 I mean, we can't like, there's days

01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:19.400
 where we really need to go somewhere and we just,

01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:21.840
 we can't because we can't leave the house

01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:23.680
 'cause he won't come and we don't have a babysitter.

01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:25.960
 Like, we have no idea.

01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:26.800
 I have no idea.

01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:30.320
 I tell myself, I hope six months from now,

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:33.000
 like every year, I think will get easier

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.480
 'cause I think he learned, he'll learn to cope

01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:38.960
 and just social pressures and things will help.

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:40.280
 But this has been a tough age.

01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:41.880
 So yeah, I have no idea if it'll work.

01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:43.880
 We just, we hope we can get him on a plane again.

01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:45.560
 He used to fly, like when we were little,

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:48.200
 when he was little, we took him places.

01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:51.400
 Anyway, it's just got intimate.

01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:53.360
 I guess that's what this podcast is.

01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:57.120
 Just, we talk about real life stuff.

01:21:57.120 --> 01:21:58.200
 We've been talking a long time.

01:21:58.200 --> 01:21:59.840
 This is an hour and 26.

01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:01.600
 Whoa, it's a long episode.

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:02.840
 I know.

01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:03.680
 Who makes it to me?

01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:04.520
 There's a little bit in the middle

01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:06.060
 that gets cut out when I peed.

01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:06.960
 What's that?

01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:08.160
 If people made it to the end?

01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:09.000
 No, whatever.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:09.840
 Where's this thing right now

01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:11.000
 are people that made it to the end?

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:12.960
 And they're, they're truly a special ones.

01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:14.160
 Yeah, that's pretty crazy, actually.

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:15.800
 To think, can you imagine listening to us

01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:17.360
 for an hour and 26 minutes?

01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:19.040
 I mean, I guess like they could speed it up.

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:20.800
 They could do two times.

01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:21.640
 Cool.

01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:22.720
 That's another thing.

01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:24.800
 So I listen to podcasts.

01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:26.440
 Well, I lately not as much,

01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:28.120
 but I always listen to it.

01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:29.760
 Some multiple, right?

01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:33.240
 And if you ever listened to them at one time speed,

01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:34.240
 their voice is so different.

01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:36.240
 They sound drunk and stupid.

01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:37.560
 And do you ever think about that?

01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:40.080
 Like people who listen to us on 1.5 speed or whatever,

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:42.440
 if they heard it's in person, they'd be like,

01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:43.800
 it's talk so slow.

01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:45.760
 I don't want to think about that.

01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:47.080
 Yeah.

01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:48.600
 A big part of my identity is sounding

01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:50.240
 like I know what I'm talking about.

01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:52.160
 So if you're coming across stupid,

01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:53.400
 like it's not good.

01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:55.680
 This is actually why I haven't learned Spanish

01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:59.360
 is because I haven't gotten over

01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:03.200
 the fear of sounding stupid.

01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:04.040
 Yeah.

01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:05.880
 There's a lot of reasons I haven't learned Spanish.

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:07.640
 I guess that might be one of the other ones.

01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:08.720
 You have no reason to.

01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:10.440
 That's right.

01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:11.280
 Meanwhile,

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:13.800
 I live in a place where people mostly speak Spanish.

01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:15.320
 Oh, yeah, okay.

01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:16.520
 You've got some.

01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:18.360
 Yeah, does Liz speak Spanish?

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:19.800
 Yeah, she speaks Spanish perfectly.

01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:21.440
 Her whole family only speaks Spanish.

01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:22.960
 So I have a lot of reason to learn it.

01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:23.800
 That's crazy.

01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:25.240
 Yeah, you should learn Spanish, you jerk.

01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:26.080
 Come on.

01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:26.920
 Yeah, but I don't want to sound stupid

01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:28.280
 with their family, so.

01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:29.720
 It's fine.

01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:31.120
 I know it's fine.

01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:32.480
 It'll be in the earring.

01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:33.480
 Actually, it's fine.

01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:34.320
 I know.

01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:35.160
 I know all this intellectually.

01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:36.000
 Yeah.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:36.840
 Okay.

01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:37.680
 There's something in my core.

01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:38.680
 Emotionally.

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:39.520
 Yeah.

01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:40.360
 Yeah.

01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:41.200
 Okay.

01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:42.040
 There's something I want to do here.

01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:42.880
 We're at the end of the episode.

01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:44.760
 Maybe I should do this.

01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:46.120
 We should do this every episode, maybe.

01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:47.560
 Just thank some people.

01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:50.400
 'Cause like, this podcast is bigger than us

01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:52.520
 by just a little bit.

01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:53.800
 Thank you, Chris, for editing.

01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:55.720
 We joke about it, but he's really good.

01:23:55.720 --> 01:23:56.560
 Yeah.

01:23:56.560 --> 01:23:57.400
 Like, we don't have to think about anything.

01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:58.880
 He publishes the thing.

01:23:58.880 --> 01:23:59.720
 He does it all.

01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:01.280
 He gets it out there.

01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:02.760
 He has a fine descriptions.

01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:03.760
 Yeah.

01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:06.520
 I laugh so Adam worries about the point of even living.

01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:08.320
 That's such a good story.

01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:09.960
 Such a perfect story.

01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:11.760
 Yeah, I know.

01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:13.080
 So thank you, Chris, for the editing

01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:14.640
 and for everything else you do.

01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:15.480
 And thank you, Haley.

01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:18.120
 Haley's been doing all the little like social posts,

01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:18.960
 little clips.

01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:19.800
 Thank you, Haley.

01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:21.560
 I've not acknowledged you too publicly.

01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:23.120
 Thank you for, I don't even know if she listens.

01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:26.160
 I think she's listened to some of it.

01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:27.840
 She may not get this far to know.

01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:28.680
 This is for nothing.

01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:29.520
 No, it's not.

01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:30.360
 It's publicly, thank you.

01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:32.760
 Okay, I should really not do thank yous.

01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:35.000
 If they're gonna be this long every time.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.360
 It should just be a little thing at the end where I'm like,

01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:38.480
 thank you, Chris, for editing.

01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:40.320
 Thank you, Haley, for the social clips.

01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:41.200
 Okay, see ya.

01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:44.240
 But instead, I turned it in like a minute and a half.

01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:46.160
 Are you frozen or are you staring at me like that?

01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:47.000
 No, I've been done that.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:48.040
 I've been done that for a while, right?

01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:48.880
 I haven't done that anymore.

01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:51.160
 I just let you talk and I'll just stare at you.

01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:52.800
 Just make me uncomfortable.

01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:55.280
 Okay, we did it.

01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:57.200
 We made it through an episode when I had

01:24:57.200 --> 01:24:59.840
 something like 250 milligrams of caffeine in my system.

01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:00.680
 Okay.

01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:02.000
 No food.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:02.920
 Well, good times.

01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:04.040
 Go put that to work.

01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:04.880
 Whatever's up there.

01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:05.720
 I'm going to, yeah.

01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:07.600
 You know what actually, the last thing,

01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:11.200
 I drank all that coffee this morning, thinking like,

01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:12.920
 it's fine, I'm just gonna get so much done

01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:14.760
 and I forgot we had a podcast.

01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:17.400
 This is totally interrupting all my like,

01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:18.800
 caffeine usage.

01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:20.400
 Anyway, hour and 30.

01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:21.680
 All right, see you next.

01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:23.160
 We'll see you.

01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:25.740
 (upbeat music)
