WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920
 you know like for me transferring my what I know and believe about software engineering and also

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.320
 transferring just some of the love I feel I feel like you know with your product with

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.160
 with clawed code with any good product what makes it good is like it tastes good you know it's

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.240
 it's like a dish that you cook like you can just taste the love in it you know and that's something

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.000
 that was just made by the guys clocking in nine to five is not that good and and those products

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:36.960
 are the ones that win absolutely

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.840
 so what are you joining us from by the way i live on the west side of san francisco out by the

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:02.720
 beach okay nice how is that oh it's great well actually this time of year is the worst you know

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.880
 it's like can't see your hand in front of your face soupy fog oh really it's a nice day yeah that

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.800
 never happens at july for so it's like summer is not the best time no september october that's

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.320
 the best time oh really okay like at the beach are there are there beachgoers in san francisco

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.840
 what's that what's that like sure yeah you wouldn't really go in the water unless you have a wet suit

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.160
 but people come out here actually there was this proposition that passed um in the last election

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:38.720
 to close the great highway and turn it into a park and it was very controversial you know the

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.920
 people who live out here wanted it to be a road because of traffic and you know they just are

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.160
 worried about getting their groceries and stuff but everyone else in san francisco is like yeah we

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.200
 just want to come and walk around there so they shut the road down and it's been pretty good actually

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.600
 even i feel like even the people who were super against it are like yeah okay this is kind of nice

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.080
 there's often people out there you know it's it's a good place to be was that related to covid at all

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.960
 yeah that was when they first shut it down and then then there was this compromise where it's

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.240
 open during the week and close on the weekends which that was fine too i don't know i was you know i

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.960
 was with all the residents i was like kind of opposed to it and then it passed and i was like you know

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.400
 i'm retroactively for this i think it's gonna be good and so i jumped on the bad rat get it worked

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.120
 out it's funny because uh there's so many stories exactly like that all over the place uh because i

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.200
 live in new york during covid and they shut down a bunch of streets and a lot of them are like now

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.920
 perma shut down which is nice they've turned to really nice things now i live in miami and there's

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.640
 a street that we love that's just all restaurants like it's just and they fully sell it in i didn't

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.520
 know until recently that was used to be a normal road and covid happened and they and they transformed

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:54.320
 it so uh yeah it's been nice it's been nice having more like walkable areas to hang out in

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.680
 i don't know if any of that happened in the Ozarks Adam hmm there are no walkable areas in the Ozarks

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.000
 i mean you can walk you just don't get to anything useful you just kind of walk arbitrarily walking

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.880
 for walking sake yeah yeah i do that a lot actually Adam how long how long have you been at anthropic i

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.960
 know you've got the react history how long since you joined inropic yeah it's been a little over a

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:27.280
 year um really exciting times it feels like 10 years but oh yeah that's plenty did you join to

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.040
 like directly work on cloud code or like what was the uh situation well i joined you know i when i

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:40.240
 saw gpt three and three five especially i was like the this thing is going to be awesome for coding

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.800
 you know i just i've got to work on that i got to get closer to it like i do not just want to be

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:53.280
 user i want to be i want to know how it gets made um so i eventually i joined this team at at uh

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.840
 anthropic called the quantification team and the intention there was to accelerate the internal

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:08.560
 technical staff with ai it was like part of the developer productivity team um so that's how i

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.840
 joined it that's what i was originally working on it's just the thing about like kind of putting an

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.920
 effort um like that inside developer productivity is like it's always like hey you can have all these

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:26.400
 neat wizzy things or we could just fix ci you know because like you end up just going to the bottom

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.320
 of these infrastructure things like i i worked on like how to log the usage of zad at anthropic

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:38.720
 for like a month you know um which you know like you you actually really want to know that if

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.560
 you're really trying to empower your staff but it was also it also really cured my rust fanboy

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:52.880
 my presentation with rust yeah it's funny because uh i never thought about any of those things because

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:59.440
 i've mostly worked at like on my own stuff for like really small small teams but especially with a

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:06.640
 lot of lm stuff coming into uh like developer workflows we've been talking about bigger companies and

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.600
 they're all really obsessed with trying to understand how their team is using this stuff better and

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.640
 having like analytics and and metrics and better insight into those things it makes a little sense

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.800
 but it's just something that i'd never been exposed to before yeah if you're going to spend as much

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:27.600
 as it costs to empower every dev with ai you kind of need to prove that it's worth it yeah yeah okay

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:33.680
 so i want to ask you cuz dax and i talk about this cycle we have where it's like some days or

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:39.520
 some weeks or like this is the future of everything and it's going to change my job forever and then

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.240
 there's like days where you just have a bad day with yellow limb and you're like f this i'm never

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.440
 using it again do you from your perspective being inside of anthropic do you have a different

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.960
 perspective on that as a developer because you kind of like you know something about the internal

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.520
 things going on in anthropic whether that's future road map or whatever do you have a different

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.280
 perspective or do you feel like just every other dev where you're like good days and bad days

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.720
 i want this to be better i know it's the future some days it's just not there i'm just curious if

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.440
 you have any thoughts yeah i listen to you guys religiously so of course i know you guys you talk

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.440
 about that a lot and i just sit there shaking my head because like we're not in my head i shouldn't

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.640
 say i feel the exact same way and you know i think there are two there are a few different

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.360
 aspects to it you know like one thing is like i've gone through all these little mini eras with

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:35.360
 technique so like like at one point my editor broke and i didn't really fix it you know what i mean

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.560
 like all the highlighting was broken all that stuff let me guess what editor you were using

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:46.960
 okay i don't want to throw anybody under the bus i went back to femme and it's like okay i know this

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:53.840
 works yeah but but it broke and i so i was like oh i'll just use quad code to do everything you know

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.960
 i mean i'm like oh let's call this variable x instead of y you know and like when you try to use

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:05.280
 the lm for that you're doomed like that is actually a terrible use of the lm like and i think hand

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:11.520
 finishing things is is that's what i do now at least and like you know and then you also just

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:18.000
 sort of realize like well how big a chunk do you need you know like i think i so part of it i think

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.560
 is like we are changing it's skill issues yeah there are but it is skill issues is really true

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:30.400
 and the skill is not like oh i know how to write a prompt it's just like i'm able to come to this

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:36.480
 with a fresh mind when a new model comes out when a new feature comes out you know even like plan

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:42.560
 mode has kind of changed how i use quad code um so you really have to adapt quickly and i think

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:49.360
 i you know as someone who's always spent like hours and hours tweaking my vin can fig it's

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:54.880
 sort of a dream you know like i just i prefer to only do the meta and not actually have to push

00:07:54.880 --> 00:08:01.520
 any bigger production but yeah it is fun on one hand it's been a lot because things change so

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:07.200
 quickly and yeah you have good days and bad days but uh it is fun just because we're all

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:12.240
 disaffectively just messing with our editors which we all love to do and that's effectively what

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:18.080
 all of this is uh just seeing how our flows can change um i've been i've been into it and i think

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:23.280
 the part that i've enjoyed is uh whenever there's something new that's different than how i normally

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:29.280
 do things i like everyone resist it to some degree because any kind of change is painful

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:34.400
 um but then something flips in my brain where i try to overuse it on purpose to see like

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:40.480
 what the extreme version of this is like and in that process you usually gain a good amount of

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:47.760
 insight so i also did try to use uh lms to even do like simple edits things that i could do in a

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:53.200
 few keystrokes with uh with my keyboard uh and surprise i think i was surprised i think it was a

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:57.200
 it definitely wasn't great like obviously using an actual editor makes this is the right choice

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:05.600
 there but i found a different kind of workflow where i was just queuing stuff up like i was like

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.200
 going through a file and like every little thing i would just queue up and then i would

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:14.960
 go to the next thing instead of like getting it done um and i think in net that probably wasn't

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:19.520
 my favorite but it was like a new workflow that i wouldn't have thought of before yeah i wouldn't

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:27.920
 big thing that's like kind of the fad at anthropic right now is like not to correct the lm um so

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:34.320
 you know because the lm doesn't see interruption from the user in training really uh and actually

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:39.760
 you'll notice that like sometimes if you interrupt Claude enough it'll actually hallucinate interruptions

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:44.320
 which is super annoying you're like no keep going interrupting yourself buddy

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:50.400
 but like you know like that's a good example of one where like then i sort of feel like i over

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:56.080
 rotated on that i'm like afraid to update it you know so like i don't know it it's funny just how

00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:02.720
 much presence of mind it takes to like really really make sure that like what you what you're

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:08.160
 trying is helping you or you know to as you say to like learn something from it and not just like

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:12.800
 fall into it so when you say when you the fad is to not interrupt it do you mean you start it over

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:17.920
 or like what what exactly do you mean by that i mean like you give it an you give it a detailed

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:23.600
 prompt you give it as much tooling as you can you give it you shouted it like you must pass all

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:30.480
 the tests before you keep going yeah do not add comments so that one doesn't work that would

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:37.680
 not work that was not effective but you know you give it all your instructions up front and then

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:43.440
 you just like kind of let it cook for like kind of you know you're trying to get it to go on its

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:49.760
 own for as long as you can and then you come back to it and you like review the whole diff it's

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:55.040
 created and you sort of give your feedback on it and then you kind of you know move on to the next

00:10:55.040 --> 00:11:01.200
 terminal window that one thing i think about a lot is like there's the difference between it being

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:06.160
 awesome and it's sucking is the difference between you sitting there watching the lm do stuff while

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:13.120
 you do nothing and the lm doing stuff while you're doing something else and then there's also this

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:18.160
 question of like if the other thing you're doing is scrolling twitter is that good or bad yeah i

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:25.680
 think we talked about this yeah it's uh i think for me i my journey with this stuff was uh never

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:31.280
 gonna leave me of him like i just refused no matter what tooling came out i was just like no i can't i

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:39.200
 can't leave my baby uh and it eventually felt like how long can i resist this because some of these

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:44.000
 tools look pretty powerful and i got some of it inside of him like the tap complete through super

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.760
 maven things like that but i was seeing cursor and i was like man am i just going to be forced to use

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:56.640
 it at some point because the productivity is so huge uh and then cloud code came out and i think

00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:02.320
 it was a good trojan horse and that i was able to use it without like shifting anything about my

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:07.200
 editor like it was a separate thing that lived outside of it but it also introduced a totally

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:15.120
 new workflow to me where whenever i saw people using cursor it was like very active and it was

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:19.120
 trying to augment you as the person writing code which you know some of this stuff is great

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:24.480
 that the tap complete uh i think it's great for that but that never clicked for me properly uh

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:28.960
 when the cloud code came out it showed me that there they're just complete different thing where

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.880
 you can kind of fork your work in certain moments and hand something off to

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:38.800
 cloud code while you continue to do other parts of it and then check back in a knot later uh that

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.960
 was a new workflow that i'd never considered at all and that was kind of like the breakthrough

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:48.960
 for me being like okay now i see how i can incorporate this stuff in a in a much bigger way same i you

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:56.560
 know the very first thing i did this was gpt-3-5 i built an integration in neo-vim it would open a

00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:04.000
 buffer on the right by the way that is where the that is where the window belongs um you learn a

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.880
 buffer and you know just because vim it's so easy to move text back and forth and this is you know

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:14.240
 three-five did not really have tool calling people started doing that thing of like respond only with

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:19.120
 the new program or whatever but it didn't work that well so i would just use it for code understanding

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:23.120
 you know i would just like paste in a big function and be like hey how could we refactor this and

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:27.840
 honestly there's something i kind of miss about that like that was like a gold it like i learned

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:35.600
 how to do kubernetes from right um and i feel like that was like my golden era of like actually

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:40.000
 learning things from the llm i've noticed you know we talk about like these different fads

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:47.280
 lately i've noticed i've gotten really lazy i really trust especially opus like i over trust

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:52.000
 it you know i mean like i'll go back into the code i'll be like who wrote this what he's doing

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:58.160
 you know it's like oh i just i committed that pr yesterday yeah yeah yeah i i think i also had a

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:02.960
 phase where i tried like i tried some of the neo-vim tools that uh kind of brought some the

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:08.160
 functionality and editor and they like i kind of used them like it was nice to be able to select

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:15.120
 some code and be like oh you know refactor this or add this functionality uh to it but

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:20.720
 ultimately it just felt a little too clunky to really stick as something that i that i did

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:26.160
 consistently kind of like a nice to have here and there but yeah like i really i'm really into this

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:31.200
 whole thing i think that we talked about it before but it does mental model where you have kind of

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:36.000
 like a dumb idiot sitting next to you with your own laptop you can just give them stuff and they're

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.040
 not messing with what you're doing you can still be doing other stuff uh and that separation is nice

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:44.720
 because you know they are kind of dumb and you want to be able to do this other stuff while they're

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:49.920
 doing their thing yeah but like oh you know like i'll just be like hey can you just write a doc

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:56.480
 on how the installer works yes like that's just incredible i love it for that i love that yeah like

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:02.480
 we use we use a lot of monorepos and just having like a web project with like mdx files for the docs

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:07.200
 in the same monorepo and being like hey document this package is whatever feature

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:11.360
 in the web project and it just writes the mdx file it's amazing i love it for that kind of stuff

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:16.400
 yeah i guess it is like a continuum that like we back talking about this workflow and it's the

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:21.920
 cloud code kind of workflow that you guys pioneered where the human is very in the loop but they're

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:26.960
 like so many bets being made too on the completely asynchronous the jewels the whatever i don't

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:32.240
 remember the names of them Devin yeah they're kind of like give it a problem and then it comes back

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:38.720
 with the pr i guess anthropics not really doing that today right is that do you view like some point

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:43.520
 in time where the models just get so good that we don't need to be in the loop that's one of my

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:48.080
 fears is like it's not just like i'm gonna lose my job thing just like i really enjoy this whole

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:53.840
 uh cloud codey kind of workflow and i hope that it's here to stay but i wonder does anthropic do you

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:59.200
 have a different perspective being inside anthropic like is this temporary it feels transitional i

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:04.560
 mean just the fact that just that i feel like every week i come to i work and it feels a little

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:11.760
 different you know so obviously things are changing really fast i would say you know like one measure

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:18.160
 that we talk about it anthropic is how long does the agent work autonomously and i think everyone's

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:24.960
 goal is to increase that number so that is where we're headed it conflicts with something i've learned

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:29.520
 though as like having been a software developer for a pretty long time which is that like the

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:37.120
 hard part is always figuring out what you're trying to do and why yeah you know like it's always been

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:43.680
 pretty easy to like poop out of pr this question is like you know is this actually a feature that

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:49.040
 is gonna help and you know it's amazing in retrospect when you look back at like a year of what a team

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:56.880
 did how how little of it has actually helped at all you know so i like i don't there's part of me

00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:04.800
 that really is that dubious that like a three sentence prompt will be enough to make anything

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:09.600
 better i'm i'm i'm really curious to see how that plays out honestly that's how i feel when i see

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:13.680
 these people and if you've seen the twitter post where somebody's got like 16 cloud code instances

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:17.840
 running and parallel and like like how do you have that much stuff that needs done that you actually

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:23.120
 can keep it going i just like to me they're just spitting out garbage and it's like look how fast

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:28.160
 it can run i don't know that whole thing just kind of oh my god that whole world is i i you guys

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:32.480
 ran about that a lot but you know i find it kind of amusing because it's pretty clear like well

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:37.120
 obviously you're not doing anything you said posting on twitter like yeah the main one i can

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:42.720
 think of he's like ignore my mom in the background and that's just so perfect perfect

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:49.280
 perfect explanation yeah i don't know if you saw my post there today but i was like 95 percent

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:53.760
 energy goes to figuring out what the hell we should be doing and then 5 percent goes to coding

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:58.640
 and now with ai it's like 96 percent and then 4 percent so yeah it's definitely it's definitely

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:05.200
 better but like the agony of work is always uh what should we be doing why should we be doing it

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:09.360
 should we be doing this thing or the other thing and it's cool that i can spend more time on that

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:16.560
 stuff uh and i think the part that's a little bit unclear for me is a lot of the process of figuring

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:23.440
 that out is trying stuff and is doing stuff and i i wouldn't say that the lms take away from that

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:30.000
 because i can think of discrete examples where it's exactly the opposite i had a situation the

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.400
 other day where i had two totally different ideas for um halicos are in like ux flow could work

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:41.120
 and the past i would sit and think really hard about which one makes more sense and i'll commit

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:48.160
 to that and we'll build that but then now i just had both built and then i tried both and one was

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:53.360
 obviously worse than the other uh once it was implemented and in the past i would have never

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:58.000
 been able to do that so that that process of exploring still exists but i will say some of that

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.600
 is literally doing the coding as well when you're trying to figure out like architecturally how

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:06.880
 just something be structured what patterns are good what patterns are annoying um yeah i have a

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:13.200
 hard time imagining how i could be effective solely from like opening github issues and watching them

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:19.040
 get get completed yeah i totally agree i have this theory actually that like if we use these things

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:25.200
 right we can make the code a lot better you know everyone talks about how like AI makes code worse

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:31.680
 but one big difference i've noticed is like i'm much less attached to any given approach because i

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:37.680
 didn't do that much work to to get it going you know so i i totally agree and also if you try to

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:42.720
 approaches you know you just sort of look at the PR and you just look at like how many files were

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:47.040
 changed or you know i mean like like macro things and you can kind of tell one of these is going

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:52.080
 to go in more easily than the other one will and then often what i'll do is i'll like try a few

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:56.720
 different ways and then i'll be like oh this is a way to do it and then i'll go back i'll reset

00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:01.120
 everything and i'll have quad be like hey write an md file about how we're going to do this one and

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:05.040
 then they won't kind of do it step by step together yeah the step by step together is also

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:09.840
 interesting i've also found that uh i haven't used this for programming as much but for generating

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:14.800
 other things i've had it instead of giving it a prompt and being like generate the thing i need

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:21.120
 i will give it the prompt and i'll say ask me question step by step to figure out what to generate

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:24.000
 and it does such a good job of going back and forth with me and then

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.480
 pulling out the information it needs uh yeah so some of those workflows are super interesting and

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:33.440
 then the thing you're saying about improving code this from not totally related but uh

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:37.040
 adam did you see that issue that somebody opened today about how the they were like the

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:43.520
 the issue title was improve code did you see that one yeah and they pasted like an elm gave them a

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:49.120
 review of our code they just pasted as an issue there was a there's a fire in our code base that's

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:54.240
 really bad but it's bad because it's the most complex part where i've or understand the least

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:59.040
 so i'm like letting it become a mess as i understand what we need to do before we refactor it

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:04.480
 someone clearly prompted the elm with something like provide an argument as to why this code is

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:09.760
 horrible because it uses that phrasing a lot it's like it would be justified to say this code is

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:15.280
 horrible because and then it like breaks it down and then it like as person has opened this issue

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:20.000
 with this like several paragraphs of why this code sucks and it was just like you should improve it

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.800
 i'm like are you even a user of this app like when you went and did this like why

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:31.120
 uh so i wasn't annoyed then i replied being like i've replied calmly explaining why it's in that

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:36.080
 state and then i threw in uh once you get more experience like this will make more sense to you

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:44.720
 i close the issue like but yeah we get in the bad we get the good in the bad with elo limbs

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:51.280
 and open source and open source yeah great combination i'm seeing a lot more of the ai

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:57.360
 content stuff or just like search results and like twitter interactions just all kinds of random

00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:02.480
 places that i i so clearly this is not a real person that's getting more and more annoying i hope

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:06.000
 that we figure out a way to solve that i don't know that's not your problem adam i don't know

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:13.200
 you know i worked at facebook so like i am incredibly paranoid and suspicious of

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:17.440
 basically everyone i just assume everyone else is in lm

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:24.960
 that's a good starting point i love it one of the most frequent comments we get in any video we

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:32.640
 do is everyone asks if adam is a i generate they say i'm a skinwalker i've literally i never heard

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:40.480
 of this stuff until uh i got on the internet yeah yeah it's funny i can't i have this all

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:47.440
 the time where i'm like you know a year ago if you told me how much time i'd be spending thinking

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:55.440
 about whether a reply was ai gender not i wouldn't believe you but it's crazy how much of it exists

00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:02.560
 and it's in a format that isn't immediately detectable sometimes or like there's something

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:07.920
 in it that triggers something else in your brain so you don't think to think that's an lm like

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:12.960
 it'll compliment you or it'll ask you a question and immediately your brain is like in the mode to

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:17.840
 want to engage uh and there's people that have been repeat gonna quote unquote people that i've

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:24.400
 been consistently replying to my post for a while now where i only put together that was an lm

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:28.400
 because they were replying so consistently they were applying every single post and very quickly

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:33.680
 after i posted it but other than that i maybe would have thought that they were real so yeah it's

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:37.760
 crazy how much of my energy is going into figuring that out well yeah i mean again starting with

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:44.880
 facebook i sort of noticed how the technological limitations and implementations really influence

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:50.880
 the culture you know like like obvious examples like eight bit right like that that's a whole style

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:56.080
 even when you have plenty more than eight bit you know you're rendering 4k HD but it looks like

00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:02.400
 eight bit right um and i feel like ai now has really suffused the culture like that kind of

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:10.240
 hallucinating dreamy you know there is like that little like retro futuristic time we had that

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:14.640
 you know when mid journey was really good at that yeah it's interesting i guess i'm what i've

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:20.080
 said is like the people start to imitate the ai i think too like another aspect of that yeah

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:25.520
 yeah i i had this crazy experience once where i somehow ended up on some weird twitter space

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:34.320
 and i was pretty sure it was a person acting like an llm where they would respond with weird delays

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:39.520
 but the responses were like very good and the person was claiming that they were like an

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:44.880
 unreleased model or something but ultimately wasn't actor at the end of the day i'm like this is so

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:52.000
 circular crazy i can't believe this type of stuff is happening um then you go try to explain that to

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.440
 like your normal friend that's like what are you talking like that person pretending to be an AI

00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:05.120
 what are you yeah well so that's another thing so as much as every zone conversation we have

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:09.680
 everything we see everything we read is all about like coding and coding with llms and obviously

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:16.080
 people that are programmers by trade are like more plugged into this stuff than the average person

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:22.720
 despite that there's still so many people that have not tried using llms for programming at all

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:26.960
 still it's still like such a small percentage of people that have tried it or incorporated into

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:31.440
 their workflow um do you guys feel the same way i mean you're like more in the heart of

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:36.640
 you know everyone around you thinking about it but uh you get glimpses of how big the world

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:42.960
 actually is oh yeah well you know set aside like all the regular people who aren't programmers who

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:47.920
 haven't touched the stuff although i feel like that's actually flipping like to my best friends are

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:52.960
 like a doctor and lawyer and they a year ago they were like these things are not useful and now

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:57.440
 they're like they send me their like deep research on you know or backpacking weekend

00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:04.400
 but uh but for programmers yeah i mean you know we with quadkill we end up talking to a lot of

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:10.560
 enterprises and like there there are you know there are people who are like well our staff is

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:17.120
 really skeptical of ai and i honestly i just have to suppress my feeling of like are you kidding me

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:24.640
 like why could you be skeptical like you gotta try this thing or you know i mean it's got problems

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:30.000
 but like how could you not be curious about this it's always amazing i mean the divide between like

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:36.080
 our little circles on the hyper internet twitter crowd and like normal devs because i work with

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:42.160
 a lot of normal devs like my normal job and that it's just not on the radar like or it's just like

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:46.800
 not good enough or they don't they have some perception of it but it's not good enough and

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:51.440
 yeah it's there's a disconnect the thing that's always weird for me and i've observed this with

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:59.440
 every tech and also building stuff for developers uh i oh we often get this question of oh like why

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:07.760
 should i try it or like it to me it feels like people want a mountain of explanation and research

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:13.040
 and argument before they even try it and in my head i'm just like you can just try it you know

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:18.160
 like why do you have to be skeptical of lms you can try it and you're probably land somewhere

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:24.080
 in between like most people do uh but that that always confuse me maybe they're really busy with

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:28.720
 other stuff and they want to like disrupt any of their workflows but i can never make an argument

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:33.840
 for any new tech because you know you should just try it and see how it applies applies to you

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:39.840
 yeah i you know having worked again like with a lot of different engineers over time i just

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:47.120
 try to only work with people who write code because they love to and those people love these tools

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:52.640
 you know because like again it's just like it's fascinating like i've programmed computers for

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:58.640
 20 years but now i can talk to them are you kidding me like that that's insane you've got to use that

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:02.480
 i think there are plenty of people who just they go to their work they get their tickets done they

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:07.040
 go home they just don't even think about it you know but it's funny even for for those people like

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:15.600
 it's even better you know but i i i get what you're getting at there's like there's a level of

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:22.320
 reflecting on like the meta that not everyone has the habit of doing which i guess is alien to me

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:29.920
 but i've seen it enough where people do need to be given like again i just always imagine like a

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:34.000
 large book report like i feel they're asking for like a big book report explaining all the reasons

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.840
 and all the pros and cons before they'll even dip a toe uh again just weird for me because i

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:45.760
 like just seems to cost nothing okay do you think these devs that don't that aren't really interested

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:50.240
 in the meta that aren't on twitter and that aren't all these things the ones that just like check

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:54.640
 into their job do their work and then go home do you think they're happier not in like the

00:28:54.640 --> 00:29:00.080
 i know that's a dumb question do you think like they're more present with their families do you

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:09.360
 think they're more uh like i i have this issue uh where i'm very like uh entrepreneurial whatever

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:13.760
 ambitious in life and like i go very hard at programming and everything i do and i'm very

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:19.040
 online and all these things and i worry that it's maybe like i don't know taking me away from the

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:25.760
 people i love i'm not as present as i could be i'm sorry adam

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:28.960
 i think this is a question i love that question that's great

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:34.240
 my first answer is like no way how can they be happier because i my guess would be they

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:39.840
 approached their family and their hobby and everything else the same way they approached their job

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:47.040
 which is like they grew it like i i think yeah to to to be engaged you know is like it's also

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:53.360
 pain right like it it's it's quite painful to sort of realize like man i spent a whole day arguing

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:58.400
 with the lm i should not have done that i spent the whole day like you know kind of being mad at my

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:03.200
 little kid even though they couldn't help it um those are like the same thing i think

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:06.720
 wow okay you didn't know you were coming to give me therapy but that was amazing

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:10.960
 actually do you actually helped me in my real life so thank you i'm going to take this one home

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:18.320
 okay yeah the other point i'll make is i think it's easy to forget the bad parts about a life

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:23.600
 lived that way so i think the upside is you can check out there's a good ability to check out

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:28.400
 but the problem is you can't check at 100% of time there's times of your life that you have to be

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:33.200
 checked in you know for eight hours a day whatever it is and most people when you talk to them about

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:39.200
 their job every minute is just misery it's just my boss is being annoying i have to do this thing i

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:42.080
 don't think it's useful but i have to do it anyway you know it's like they they feel like they're

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:48.480
 working on stuff that has no point so it's like enduring misery for eight hours so you can escape

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:54.880
 for the others uh and i think most people unfortunately are in situations like that and i think the

00:30:54.880 --> 00:31:00.160
 thing i easily take for granted is every minute of my day now i feel like i'm working on i'm like

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:04.240
 spending it the best i could possibly be spending it and parts of it are hard and painful of course

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:09.440
 but there's no chance i would ever get burned out because i'm not doing stuff i don't believe in

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:14.240
 but you know there was a lot like there was a point in my life where that wasn't the case and

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:18.400
 i remember what that was like and i remember like always being annoyed and so many cycles in my

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:23.440
 brain just thinking about how stupid my like company was for a certain reason or like my team

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:29.200
 was for a certain reason um and that all faded and i haven't been in that situation for years now

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:36.320
 and that like shows up in other parts of your life right it doesn't stay at work yeah what Adam

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:41.760
 helped me realize is man this conversation it's going all over the place uh just helped me realize

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:45.120
 that like i've always had the work part checked where i'm happy with my work and i'm excited about

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:49.440
 my work i can't hardly sleep because i'm excited to wake up and work i've always said that part it's

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:55.680
 the interpersonal connectedness relationships that i've not been so good at like i'm a present dad

00:31:55.680 --> 00:32:02.160
 but i'm not so emotionally available anyway uh you've made me realize that i can go hard at that

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:05.680
 too i just haven't learned how to do it yet like i go hard at everything in life and i just don't

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:09.040
 know how to do that part yet so i'm gonna figure that part out too and like if i were somebody who

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:13.920
 just checked in maybe i'm a just kind of a slothful person and i wouldn't do those things to better

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:20.320
 myself on that area so anyway i'm better yeah thank you you fixed me wow that's so real for me i you

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:26.320
 know i'm i'm my kids are older but uh i struggled with that when my kids were younger for sure stuff

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:31.440
 i've gotten better though as you say you can't apply yourself and even figuring out how to apply

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:38.080
 yourself to that is one of the greatest challenges yeah i'm about to have my first kid so i'm gonna

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:43.200
 i'm thinking about some best stuff i'm excited for you dax i'm expecting it to humble you a little

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:50.000
 bit yes you know everyone literally there's like hundreds of people hoping for that and i i've already

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.120
 for that deck yeah i've already told everyone no matter what happens i'm just gonna be more annoying

00:32:55.120 --> 00:33:02.720
 so yes you guys need to yeah give up hope uh i gotta say this is just like for anyone who notices

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:07.680
 i'm noticing i've talked to dax a hundred fifty times on this podcast dax's voice is even different

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:11.840
 and he's like lounging because his neck is hurt you may not have wanted to say like you're this

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:16.080
 crippled person right now but he i can tell you're like your voice is different yeah my voice is

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:21.520
 quivering it's weird so this morning after my run i literally bent down to pick something up

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:27.600
 and i turned my neck at the same time and something just like popped in the back and it's been really

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:33.440
 painful and like it's affecting the way i speak it's yeah pretty crazy and you're like you're laying

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:39.840
 back like this i'm trying to find positions that are they're not painful uh yeah so i've just

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:45.520
 been rooting for that at all well i was thinking i'm like i'm glad i don't have a kid yet because

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:50.320
 like i feel like hold the baby and do all that stuff right now it'd be pretty hard oh jeez yeah

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:55.680
 so cloud codes like kind of taking off i don't know we haven't really talked about like the rise

00:33:55.680 --> 00:34:01.920
 of cloud code i feel like yeah i i don't know what chart it was i saw but like it's definitely

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:06.960
 exploding especially on twitter like i feel like a lot of people is it just just come down to like

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:15.040
 i don't want to use vs code is that it is it just like people that don't want to use

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:21.680
 an editor baked into their ai thing i'm you know i'm not sure i think um like the the

00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:29.840
 growth has been absolutely insane like it's like 300% usage increase in the last four weeks

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:36.480
 uh wow kind of stuff that you just don't really see uh 90% of the code like within anthropic it's

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:43.200
 even really taking off like um you know our team like almost all of the code is written with the

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:50.640
 help of the lm like a couple things first of all the new models the four models are much better

00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:55.200
 you know and it's funny because like you use them at first and you're like this doesn't this

00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:59.760
 isn't that much better it's not like it's so much smarter but just being a little more steerable

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:05.040
 and a little more you know i had this amazing experience with opus where i kind of gave it an

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:11.600
 ambiguous prompt and it came back and it was like wait a sec do you mean a or b hmm and i was like

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:18.080
 oh i've never seen that from the model before that's like a new behavior um so i i think the new

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:24.800
 model is really unlocked something new and in some ways i think quad code is just the easiest way

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:31.040
 to get at those things you know you can you like bring your own subscription and you especially if

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:36.080
 you sign up for the max plan it sort of feels like all one thing whereas with these other things you

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:41.360
 have to like plug your keys in and it's just like one extra step yeah i you know i i can't quite

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:47.760
 explain the why why quad code has been so popular especially there are other good options out there

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:54.160
 for sure um but i think like a lot of it is the model the new model yeah do you just default to opus

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:59.680
 this is a question i have for an anthropic engineer do you default to opus ever use sonnet like is

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:05.040
 there a reason no actually i'll tell you i joined anthropic in part so i can have unfettered access

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:09.520
 to the top model i was like i do not out pay anything but i'm not getting rate limited

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:16.560
 yeah so now i can play an inference tier it's awesome it's awesome but there's not like i haven't

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:21.600
 quite figured out with programming dax uses sonnet i mostly use opus and i don't know if there's

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:25.520
 material difference like i don't know if either one of us has got a sense for if we should use one

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:32.560
 or the other i'm very happy like i'm a very happy user with just sonnet uh i think i will switch to

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:40.480
 opus occasionally but yeah i think i'm sure opus is better but i'm surprised at how satisfied i am

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:47.760
 just using sonnet you know sonnet is just as good as at opus for coding tasks i would say and also

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:55.200
 you know when we do we actually have a horrible problem trying to tell internally if a model if one

00:36:55.200 --> 00:37:01.520
 model is better than another like that's actually much harder than it sounds the users will generally

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:08.640
 pick the shorter answer that was delivered faster right um and especially because we can't really do

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:14.960
 like long trajectories with one model versus the other it's like kind of one tool prompt usually

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:19.120
 and it's really hard to tell often what the difference you know they're very similar responses

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:27.120
 um so i just stick to opus i you know one flavor of twitter maxing that i really hate is like

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:34.560
 i use this model for planning that model to write job on this model where it's like dude you just

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:42.080
 get a life dude yeah so i can just keep a pin on opus that's fine with me but you know sonnet's

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:47.040
 really good too they're both better than sonnet three seven nine you know yeah sure that guy was a

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:55.360
 jerk it was just like wait for tests and write stupid comments yeah so let's talk a bit about

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:59.680
 the form factor of cloud code which is all in the terminal yeah like what like what are your

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:07.200
 thoughts on that is this you see this as like just like a like nice angle you guys found or is this

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:12.720
 like a form factor you kind of are betting on i think it's fundamental and actually i think the

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:21.680
 fact that like it's it's in the terminal interactively is almost like a stepping stone to it being

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:28.480
 a much more composable linux utility you know like the thing i've always wanted is um

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:37.280
 cube cuddle list pipe quad what's what's wrong here or cube cuddle describe or whatever um and

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:42.960
 actually it's surprising how we we've all what leaned hard into coding but like it's been harder to

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:48.080
 crack like some of these sRE things there's some great new products coming but it hasn't quite

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:54.800
 happened yet ultimately i think the fact that you end up typing into the terminal and viewing

00:38:54.800 --> 00:39:00.880
 diffs in the terminal is it's kind of neither here nor there you know it's it's fine but the real

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:07.840
 the real power is that if this can run anywhere you've a prompt and for me you know the fact that i

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:14.560
 can run this inside a docker container or i can easily like i run it on a pi zero you know that i

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:21.920
 connect to using mosh um that's where the like i think that that's what i'm really excited about

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:26.720
 with these uh going back to the terminal that that's how we saw it too we're like this is just so

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:32.640
 flexible there's no excuse someone would have to not use this no matter what their workflow

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:39.200
 what their environment uh on your computer on a server in a github ci thing i think that's that's

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:45.040
 the brilliant part about packaging it in this way the other funny thing i've seen is there's

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:50.560
 especially with cloud club blowing up as it has there's been a few like big posts where people

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:57.120
 were like i don't get it like why do people like doing stuff in their terminal like it's uh like

00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:04.000
 how how would you ever prefer that over a ui and i think if cloud code wasn't growing as much as it

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.800
 was i would like look at those posts and be like that's a good point because maybe this isn't as

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:16.000
 mass market as it is but in the face of people saying that and it growing so much there's like

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.920
 a more interesting thing that happens which is clearly something counterintuitive is happening

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:24.880
 that people aren't getting but it's still clicking with a bunch of people so i i love seeing that

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:30.400
 it's like a good sign that uh something is really working when people are confused as to why it is

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:36.320
 working i you know a part of me thinks too like when i open vs code you know almost always by accident

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:45.600
 like i just i just sort of feel like i feel like this thing has gone over some kind of critical

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:50.640
 threshold like i like the fact that we find ourselves in this place where there are no viable

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:58.080
 ids i wonder if that fuels this a little bit too like it just everything inside vs code to me

00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:04.960
 it just it turns me into this like consumer you know which is like the opposite of how i want to

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:10.800
 feel when i'm programming my computer right yeah it's in one of these posts i won't took a screenshot

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:15.760
 of i think it was cursed so they're like like a terminal could never recreate all this and i was

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:19.760
 looking at the screenshot i'm like that looks crazy and overwhelming and there's so much stuff going

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:26.160
 on um well one of the terminal could recreate it but like i don't think i want to yeah absolutely

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:31.600
 so i mean going going more on this format on this form factor uh so you you probably obviously

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:35.680
 seeing this stuff we're doing the open code we're taking it in like a more extreme direction of like

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:40.480
 how far can we push all the tricks you can do in the terminal given like the years we've spent

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:45.760
 doing tricks in the terminal with uh what's the terminal too many years why did you do that thing

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:52.400
 we figure out the theme i was so impressed i haven't yet looked at how you did that uh how how like

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:57.920
 matches your system theme yeah oh so like a system theme is just your terminal just remapping the

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:02.800
 standard set of colors to other colors yeah and so as long as we render using the standard colors

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:09.440
 it'll it'll show up right oh the ends easier to 15 basically most i guess now to up to 255 you can

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:15.840
 customize in most terminals so if you just use those colors yeah it tends to work okay yeah yeah

00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:20.880
 so that this has been fun for us because uh you know we're trying to like see how much we can do

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:27.600
 we already know what the the ceiling is it's like me of him exists and he can do quite a lot

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:33.360
 a lot this is just like kind of inching towards that direction um i get the sense with cloud code

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:39.120
 that's not like your interest at all but yeah that kind of looked at your thoughts on that yeah sure

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:43.360
 there are a couple things that i think are really interesting about the terminal form factor that

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:50.960
 i do lean into and then what you guys do is amazing but it's like not really what we're after um so i

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:58.400
 think the first thing that's interesting about the terminal is the concurrency model because on the

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:04.960
 web you can have these like sort of threads of processes that run completely unsynchronized you

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:10.160
 know what i mean like a model over or or like a window over here has an has an async process

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:16.720
 and then the another like divided window has its own async process and those things never have to

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:22.960
 come together you know and and they often don't and it's confusing as hell you know because like

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:28.960
 they're event based and you know they they actually um they they actually don't really make sense that

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:34.000
 they're running completely uh not concurrently so one thing that's really nice about the terminal

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:39.840
 is like you do all this concurrent stuff but then you ultimately have to come back to one prompt

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:47.040
 so you get this like really thick braiding of like concurrent tool calls and you know all this stuff

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:52.240
 where you're trying to pack it all in and then it all has to stop when you take input from the user

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:58.400
 so i think you can build you actually end up building a lot more sophisticated concurrency

00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:05.360
 that way because you have these like stop points that are easy to reason about um and then there's

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:10.640
 a related thing that we've noticed which is like just simplifying the UI enough so that we can

00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:17.200
 show it and a few lines of the terminal has forced us to do so many other good things you know like

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:23.280
 like design uh constraints breed good design and the terminal is such a constraint that way it

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:30.000
 that actually really makes me happy um yeah i lose sleep over vertical space in a terminal like

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:36.000
 there's just so it feels like there's never enough vertical space that's so constrained yeah that's

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.480
 right and also with ink if you try to re-render too much of it you get all this flickering and

00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:47.120
 stuff it's it's you have like like five lines effectively you can update yeah take a footer that's

00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:51.920
 that's live and everything else is static uh yeah i mean i i also enjoy the constraints i think

00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:58.080
 there's such basic things like you can have different font sizes so if you want to show emphasis or

00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:02.480
 highlight things you can only do that through colors or bolding and at first it feels like

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:07.840
 that this is too limited but then you realize you can actually do everything you want to do

00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:12.720
 you're forced to do it in a better way and now that makes me feel like man i think web apps should

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:18.480
 all just be one font size so honestly now yes oh so when we did the terminal website david our

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:22.800
 amazing designer at terminal just said like let's make like the terminal all the fonts the same size

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:26.640
 so the entire terminal website all the pages on the terminal website it's all one font size and

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:31.840
 it just feels so good to build as a developer where you don't have to think about like what size is

00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:36.000
 this one like i know it's a muted color but like how much smaller and like you don't think about it

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.080
 at all you just literally use the same it's it's the best i wish every website could be designed

00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:45.520
 like that it looks great too like it's actually like the perfect aesthetic for right now so yeah

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:50.320
 so we do go a little bit crazier but uh even despite that there's still so many constraints

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:56.640
 the way to think about i mean we just had a situation uh this week where uh i don't work

00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:05.360
 down a feature and it wasn't it didn't feel exactly right and you have this moment of feeling like

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:10.400
 there's no way we can make this work you know like it's we're just screwed but then inevitably

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:14.240
 something does emerge and you're like okay there is a better way to go about this and something

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:18.320
 clicks oh we were missing this this thing is important and we can restructure it in this way

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:23.360
 it always shows up there's so fewer patterns to draw from so it's like discovering all the time

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:27.440
 like there's so many web patterns that you just there's an answer to every problem and like you do

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:31.920
 that thing and it's just boring with the terminal it feels so much more uncharted i know people have

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:36.240
 done some crazy stuff in terminals but you run into a situation where there's this you actually

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:41.760
 need to provide and there's no cookie cutter answer you have to like make it up it's just so fun i

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:48.400
 i think also uh balancing because we are still trying to make this these tools something that a

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:53.520
 lot of people can use obviously a neo-vam user like is all excited about all the different hot

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:58.560
 keys and they're gonna like bind a hockey for every little action but it's very easy to make

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:02.800
 features hidden by accident because they're under these complex things that most people aren't going

00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:09.120
 to discover uh so yeah balancing both that being like we care about power users but we also care

00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:16.400
 about easy adoption uh it's definitely like a very challenging like product tasks to take on but uh

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:21.840
 yeah it's really fun it's like the right level of challenge for us yeah yeah i think it's fun

00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:26.880
 too i mean the one thing i would say like i we found a way to deal with everything except

00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:31.440
 discoverability that is the thing that just kills us you know what i mean like i see all these

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:37.040
 products where it's like oh i made neo i made quad code do this and it's like no we we already

00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:43.040
 have that feature you guys you know yeah sorry i built something to hit the enter key and all this

00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:49.680
 it's like actually we have a dash p flag it does exactly yeah it's it's funny because someone asked

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:54.480
 us the other day for a tutorial and we're like hey what do you mean you want a tutorial like what

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:58.000
 like what does that mean but then i thought about it more i'm like yeah you know we have a lot of

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.640
 features and i can see how if you don't read through all the help menus and the docs like you're not

00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:07.520
 gonna you're not gonna see that um which i guess like the neo-them world that's how it all works right

00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:12.240
 there's all these people that make great content explaining things that aren't obvious uh but yeah

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:16.000
 as like someone working on a product you hate when stuff is hidden is it any different than when

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:21.040
 you worked on react like did people build worse versions of built-in hooks and stuff that like

00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:26.960
 you guys have these features already but people build their big machine on top not even knowing

00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:29.360
 because they don't read the docs just a lot of people just don't read the docs it's the same

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:32.160
 devs that just clock in and they don't love their families those ones

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:42.800
 yeah yeah that's funny uh no you know no reactors like completely different like actually the whole

00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:48.800
 the whole game with react was getting people to build stuff on top of react um so and it was open

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:54.480
 source you know and like we really wanted 90 different combo boxes because that's how you end

00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:59.520
 up with the best combo box yeah um it's the library versus app thing like clock code is in the app

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:03.840
 yeah yeah uh i was just gonna say it is like i wanted to bring up open code because i've been

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:12.080
 obsessed with this whole idea this whole concept of terminal based coding assistance uh it was very

00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:15.760
 awkward to bring it up i don't know i i'd be curious i don't like you've seen we're working on this

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:21.120
 how do you feel about us working on this does it i don't know i don't want to masking guys i love

00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:27.840
 it i think it's awesome let's go we talked about like when we were shipping clock code for the first

00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:34.080
 time we talked about making an open source and you know i love open source i did it for a long time

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:38.720
 but i really felt like it was not the right thing for yeah for clock code because i feel like the

00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:45.200
 first and top voted PR or issue for the open source version of clock code would be like give us access

00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:53.680
 to other models yeah we're never gonna do that so um so the fact like having an open version of this

00:49:53.680 --> 00:50:01.760
 with an open router you know kind of model selector makes perfect sense to me and it's just so obvious

00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:08.400
 like this is huge like what yeah what we're all doing is so big that we all need to work on it

00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:13.760
 there's like plenty of value to capture and there's plenty of like totally slightly different takes

00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:18.560
 that actually totally change the inflection of how you go after this even the fact that like

00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:25.520
 vibes wise we're like a lot more in line you know like you can jump in and out of clock code

00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:30.080
 you guys use alternate screen buffer and that actually like that is a completely different

00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:36.960
 feel even though they're both AI terminalless agents yeah yeah yeah i feel like there's not

00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:40.560
 i don't are there other people doing what we're doing with the alt screen thing because i feel like

00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:46.800
 there's like eight exact clog cloud code copies like even the big companies that are rolling out

00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:52.160
 there are awkwardly similar like they look so much like cloud code what is the point where i'm like

00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:58.000
 this like i feel it even has the same like same like behaviors where i'm like is it literally just

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:03.280
 like ripped from cloud code i'm with you on that it's sort of like did you just like have like write

00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:10.160
 a prompt after you have clog write a prompt after using the internet like like why create a cloud code

00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:16.560
 same technology decision it's crazy it's the exact same libraries like everything it's like it wasn't

00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:21.840
 thought from scratch so i feel i mean that just that signals to me like they did it because they

00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:25.280
 felt like they had to have a product in this shape but it's not something they're like passionately

00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:31.600
 pursuing and i've always found the anthropic products in general to be very good i feel you guys

00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:37.360
 are like a very good product company where i think you guys ship a little slower than some

00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:43.360
 i mean clog cloud was before i went else but i've noticed this with like using cloud on web

00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:49.600
 it tends stuff tends to come out like a little more baked and i appreciate that i feel like uh

00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:55.440
 like i stopped using chat gpt because their interface just became a crazy mess of like

00:51:55.440 --> 00:52:00.960
 toggles and selectors and i don't even know what's going on anymore um so i've always liked like i

00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:06.160
 can i can tell there's like a good product sense at the company uh yeah but some of these other

00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:12.560
 these other tools like i don't it just feels like someone was forced to to do it you know that's

00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:18.640
 like the immediate vibe i get from them well thanks thanks for that boy i gotta say it's pretty hard

00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:25.920
 to know how to drive a product org attached to an ai research lab because it always feels like man

00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:33.360
 we're not doing enough you know to like to like elicit the frontier capabilities with new products

00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:38.480
 you know like like they're just they're things right at the frontier that is like how do you unlock

00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:43.040
 that for product you know and like like memory is a good example that's an area where i feel like

00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:49.200
 open ai is maybe ahead of anthropic a little bit well in in their product um what i turn that

00:52:49.200 --> 00:53:02.800
 feature off very quickly but uh but yeah like um it's just a huge challenge you know and it all

00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:07.680
 moves so quickly that like some of the things you think even just like the the sort of product

00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:13.600
 development cycles that we're used to have to change because the the underlying technology moves

00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:19.840
 so fast yeah the the thing you were saying earlier about um cloud code not being open source i think

00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:25.120
 a lot of people try like formically they they kind of say some kind of criticism around that

00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:32.720
 i think people though like our stuff is open source but we don't really run it like a pure

00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:37.760
 open source thing we have a very strong opinionated way of how we want to build this product and

00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:42.240
 there's a lot of features that are going to be popular like popular and requested that we're

00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:47.920
 just not going to implement uh and the only reason we're open source is because we have this like

00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:52.000
 long tail of supporting all these different providers and plugins and stuff like that like

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:58.640
 we do need the community support for that i think people underestimate it's very difficult to

00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:02.960
 if when it's like once like a product like an app like this running it like a pure open source

00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:09.520
 project it's like a lot to commit to and still expect the results to be good like i think people

00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:14.160
 really underestimate that so i i think cloud code not being open source or not run like an open

00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:20.000
 source thing is that makes total sense to me yeah i you know we could talk about this a lot i'm sure

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:26.800
 but like working on react for as long as i did you know i think i think there's a lot of open source

00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:32.160
 projects where it's like yeah you can look at the source but like committing to react at this point

00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:38.640
 like it's very hard to do like even if you wanted to it's like extremely abstract and you know you

00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:46.240
 you basically need to know someone on the team to get your PR through um yeah i you know uh i

00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:50.640
 think i i think there's something to be said for like hey you can look at our source you know that

00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:56.080
 that's like certain kind of open source that i i would say you guys are mostly interested in um

00:54:56.080 --> 00:55:00.240
 you're right though that the great thing about open source is like oh someone wants to run it on

00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:06.880
 arch on a you know like arm processor or whatever we just got the next PR someone kind of looking

00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:12.240
 at the next package yeah yeah those next people yeah they they have lots of complaints about how

00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:19.680
 it could be yeah but i mean yeah to your guys credit you look at open AI who they i mean they

00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:24.800
 open source i guess jim and i's open source too but they open source the the codex thing codex CLI

00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:30.320
 like immediate PR to rewrite it and rest had they even emerged from that like they're still in the

00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:34.720
 weeds rewriting it and rest i think i don't think it even i don't know if anyone uses it yeah i

00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:38.240
 looked at their user numbers too they're like they're below hours and we launched like three

00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:43.920
 weeks ago so it's uh yeah i don't think it's at least sticking with anyone exciting times and i do

00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:48.240
 i love this space it's just like i we're all programmers like as a programmer there's there's

00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:53.280
 something so invigorating about working on something that feels like you're helping shape the future

00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:59.360
 of your field that you've worked for 15 20 years in like it's just such a i don't know it's not like

00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:05.360
 like i'm solving climate change but it's like it's a tier below that in terms of purpose you know

00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:09.520
 i mean like there's like things that would be purpose that like the whole world benefits from

00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:14.000
 there's like selfishly my career could change completely over the next five years and i want to

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.920
 be part of that i don't want to just sit back and watch what happened to me so it's very invigorating

00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:21.200
 i don't know if you guys feel that way i feel the same way adam and you know one thing i think

00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:26.640
 about is like we talk about distillation from one model to another but there's this other thing

00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:32.160
 happening which is like the distillation of all of this human knowledge and wisdom into

00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:41.040
 the models and the tools that use them and you know like for me transferring my what i know and

00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:45.200
 believe about software engineering and also transferring just some of the love i feel

00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:50.720
 i feel like you know with your product with with claw code with any good product what makes it good

00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:56.480
 is like it tastes good you know it's like a cook additionally you cook i know you guys both cook

00:56:56.480 --> 00:57:01.760
 like you can just taste the love in it you know yeah something that was just made by the guys

00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:07.760
 clocking in nine to five is just not not that good and and those products are the ones that win

00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:13.680
 absolutely yeah i feel like the timing is also so great part my personal timing i feel like i

00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:20.800
 finally know enough about my field how the world works how things work and then like something

00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:25.840
 exciting is happening where i've been alive for things like that before but i was just like too

00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:30.800
 stupid to to really work on the right thing so now i'm really excited because i feel like okay

00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:35.040
 everything is finally lining up you know i can actually you know take part in this in the way that

00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:40.480
 uh you know i've seen other people be able to take part in in previous shifts in the past so yeah

00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:45.760
 really fun times i feel like this is kind i feel like this is my second go round you know like uh

00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:52.560
 i really thought bringing functional programming to ui was gonna work and it really did and now i get

00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:58.160
 to do this ai thing all over again it's i feel very blessed oh wow yeah you the reacting like you've

00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:04.240
 basically been part of the last shift it's like there's the broad tech shifts like the internet and

00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:10.000
 mobile but like within programming you would say ai changing everything right now the last thing

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:14.000
 that really changed everything was probably react so you've kind of like rode both those

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:19.200
 trains right i mean like it feels that way i mean you know that's a very good way for it was ai's way

00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:26.400
 bigger yeah like this thing is a tidal wave and we just are just starting to feel the water go out

00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:33.040
 yeah it's i mean it's it's uh i mean just having done this type of stuff for years you can immediately

00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:39.760
 feel that because when we put stuff out in this part of the world the response is insane

00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:45.680
 like we've had success before but this is like so different it's like hitting so many nooks and

00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:51.920
 crannies that uh we never were able to touch before and it just is reminding me how massive

00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:55.920
 the world is and when you build something that potentially every single person could use it just

00:58:55.920 --> 00:59:02.960
 feels totally totally different um and very fun we're all very overstimulated right now i think uh

00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:08.320
 it's it's having this funny effect where i personally have been working less on the weekends

00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:13.840
 because i'm like so overstimulated during the week that i need to actually intentionally like

00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:20.960
 like i need to not do anything on saturday uh but yeah it's it's fun and exciting we're all just
