WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 Just DMing right now. I don't know if we should cut this out. I just don't listen to podcast. So I have no idea what we're doing is

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:59.980
 I'm sponsored by Tintree. No, I'm not. What is Tintree? It's a brand, a clothing brand. Oh, it's like, it's like an actual hat that you buy from a place that makes hats. Yeah, that you buy from a place that makes hats. That's right. You thought it was actually like a, like a swag item or something. It's usually the case, you know. Yeah, usually. No, it's a company called Tintree. They, uh, they plant tintrees for every item you buy. Oh, wow. Kind of cool. Kind of like the guy who the Tom guy.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:29.740
 Who gave away shoes to poor people every time he bought shoes. Oh, yeah, probably for them. It's probably selfish. There's probably some corporate tax right off or something. I don't know. But you feel warm and fuzzy when you do it. Yeah. Have you seen those videos that there's like, there's a few cases of this. It's like, it'll be someone that just grew a force in 10 years or something. And have you seen them walk around and plant trees? No. It's, it's really crazy. They'll have like a sack full, like little saplings. And do they like throw them into the ground or something? Yeah. Why do I know this step?

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:38.460
 And in like one motion, they'll like, they'll do something with some kind of tool and they'll like plant the tree. And then they're doing like one every like couple of seconds.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:59.720
 I guess I have seen this or I had a dream because I can, I can picture someone doing that. Like they're kind of like throwing a little sapling in like really fast. Yeah. Yeah, huh. It's crazy. The other thing though is have you seen there's this funny thing where, um, there's human made force and they'll grow and they kind of look. Oh, like, wow, that's pretty impressive. Like, we made this forest.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:28.020
 Then you'll see a side by a side shot with like an actual force and it's like way more chaotic and like crazy. Like just can't, it's hard to replicate that can't replicate nature. Does it have like, I wonder if it has downstream effects for like habitats for animals? Like they can't live there. Yeah, it's definitely less robust and and stuff like that. Yeah. It's like we plopped a, like a suburb in the middle of the field and we're like, move in. Come on, animals.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.020
 - We're good at this stuff. We're humans. We build things. We look at this forest.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:40.020
 - Liz showed me this video yesterday where it was one of those, oh, day in my life type of things.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:47.020
 But with this woman in South Africa, I don't know if you saw it, but it's like her with her young kids.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:54.020
 And they live in this complex. It's an apartment complex.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:00.020
 Then they like, they leave and they walk. And I'm like super happy, like, oh, I love living here.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:06.020
 Like, now this is my day, blah, blah. And they're walking and there's like this paved over area.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.020
 And they walk to like this cafeteria where they like, they're served dinner.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.020
 And it's like this crazy, weirdly structured life.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.020
 Like the whole community seems like they take care of everything for you.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.020
 - It's like a movie. - And it plays on designated eat area.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.020
 - It's like Pleasantville or something? - Yeah, it's exactly.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.020
 - There's a movie like that, right? - Yeah, exactly. It's like one of those like type of weird movies.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:36.020
 And it's just so weird to me that going to, and like the dad met them after work at the cafeteria.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:43.020
 It's like eating a cafeteria as a family. It's something just weird about that, you know?

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:50.020
 It feels like there's something, this is like post-apocalyptic and they were able to survive in this community or something.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:55.020
 - I'm going to say something and you're going to make fun of me because I'm that boring white family

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.020
 that moves in with the white Tesla in your neighborhood in the big cube box.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.020
 We looked at a neighborhood like this, like this crazy planned community in Florida

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.020
 where they had like this whole main street with like all these shops

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:13.020
 and there's like little like electric go-karts that everyone can just ride around freely and leave forever.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.020
 - Golf carts? - Or golf carts. Yeah, golf carts.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.020
 - They had like-- - Golf carts would be fun.

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:22.020
 - They had like multi-seat bikes where like families could hop on a bike and ride it,

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.020
 but you just like leave them laying wherever. It's like the whole community.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:31.020
 The whole, it has like a store, like a grocery store and like a, whatever, town center.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.020
 There's just like this whole thing played out and like your whole life just lives in this little community

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.020
 or this big community. It's like a huge amount of Florida, whatever.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.020
 What's that called? Not the swamp. They like converted a bunch of--

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:52.020
 - Was this literally like Disney? 'Cause Orlando is famously, or like Disney has famously these like planned--

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.020
 - Oh, really? - Back when like Walt Disney was still alive, like they were doing all this crazy stuff.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.020
 There's parts of Disney World in Florida that are like planned communities like that.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.020
 - Where you can live there? - Yeah, it's like designed by Disney.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:09.020
 - Now this was South Florida. It was a, I think it's somewhere between like Naples and Fort Myers.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.020
 It was a, it was this X NFL player that like retired and built this community. I don't know.

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.020
 - Interesting. - It was interesting. I'll find the name of it.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:23.020
 But it definitely had those vibes like everybody's just like wearing the same thing and like,

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:29.020
 "Hi, neighbor!" Like creepy kind of vibes. But we considered it.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.020
 And it's like everyone has to build one of these like three different types of houses.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.020
 And you have to choose one of these builders.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.020
 - I mean, my parents, my parents house is one of those type of situations. It's like one of five models.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:44.020
 - That was very interesting. - It's crazy when real estate developers go beyond the house and they're like,

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:49.020
 "Okay, we gotta like make this more attractive. So we're gonna build these like businesses and everything."

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.020
 It's like kind of one cohesive thing. I definitely got the appeal. Like there's definitely like,

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.020
 like a lot of stuff just taken care of for you. But the reason I thought of this was it's like the forest.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:02.020
 Like when you do a centrally planned thing, it's just gonna feel off.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:08.020
 Like no matter how hard you try. What's interesting is my neighborhood in New York, Battery Park,

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:15.020
 it's somewhat of a planned community, more so than like any other part of New York.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.020
 'Cause it used to be a landfill. - It's like the very tip, right?

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.020
 - Yeah. - It used to be like the tip of, yeah, okay.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.020
 - It used to be a landfill. So basically when they would, yeah, when they would like dig up--

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.020
 - They used to be a landfill. - Wow. New York City landfill.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.020
 - But they would dig up like other parts of New York to like build stuff.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:37.020
 They would just dump everything off the coast in the Hudson.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:43.020
 And eventually it was so much stuff that they basically built new land by doing this.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:47.020
 They expanded the land out from digging all this stuff from the center of the island.

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:54.020
 And they cut like a perfect rectangle. And they like actually like codified it and made it like stable ground.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:59.020
 And then all Battery Park is on a land lease. So like all the buildings were like,

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.020
 I think they're leasing the land from the government.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.020
 And it's like the semi-planned thing.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:09.020
 But it's actually, I would say for a planned thing, it came out pretty good.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:16.020
 But it has the exact same problem, which all planned things have, which is, it's just brittle.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:22.020
 There's not really like the right type of businesses, like they're kind of in like weird locations.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.020
 Like the natural emergence of them didn't pop up.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:29.020
 Where for what it has, like it has really great parks like right on the water.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:34.020
 Like it's super nice in a lot of ways, but it feels totally different from the rest of New York,

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.020
 where you can just like walk one foot and like run into like a great restaurant,

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.020
 or like you can kind of get everything you need at arms reach.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.020
 This feels like something's like a little off.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:46.020
 It's also in New York. So there's that downside.

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.020
 I mean, you have to live on Manhattan.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.020
 Well, we're going to get it.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:53.020
 Assuming you're coming, because you said we're going to New York in November.

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.020
 And I'll try to show you a better time than you had before.

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.020
 What are the dates?

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.020
 What are the dates?

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.020
 We're going to get there.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:03.020
 Nope. So we're going to, we'll let's apply, help us book everything next week.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:07.020
 November 15th to the 20th is a plan.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.020
 15th to the 20th.

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:11.020
 Yeah, I think, I think so.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:14.020
 I better double check with Casey, but I think it's clear.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.020
 I can't miss a terminal gathering.

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:18.020
 That's like, I know.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.020
 Yeah.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:23.020
 What are you been doing?

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.020
 Well, what's been going on?

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:27.020
 What is happening on the internet?

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:28.020
 Ask you what are you been doing?

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:30.020
 Because you've basically fallen off the face of the earth.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:31.020
 No one has heard from you.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.020
 Yeah, I've been reflecting.

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.020
 I think I do this every like six months.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:37.020
 I think I have like a, yeah, I'm done with Twitter.

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:39.020
 I'm done with the internet.

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.020
 I guess normally I'm a little more high touch.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.020
 Like, even if I drop off of Twitter, like with you.

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:47.020
 We skipped the podcast last week.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:51.020
 So literally submitted the stat news app to the store this morning.

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.020
 Wow.

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.020
 Finally.

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:59.020
 It was like this crazy crescendo to like, I hit the button and then it was like, I'm sorry.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:04.020
 You can't submit because you like track or something and you had to fill out this form and blah, blah, blah.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.020
 It was like this big rejection as soon as I hit the button.

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.020
 It was so anti-climatic.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:12.020
 So then I had to spend an hour like doing a bunch of Apple paperwork, but then I submitted it.

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:13.020
 So it's submitted.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.020
 It feels good.

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.020
 They're going to reject it probably.

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:20.020
 I mean, probably, no, honestly, too many web views.

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:22.020
 I don't know how people do this.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:25.020
 So if we talked about mobile development on here much.

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.020
 No, you probably, it's all probably fresh in your mind now.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.020
 It's very fresh in my mind.

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:30.020
 It's such a, okay.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:34.020
 So the dilemma for us, like we have this giant website, right?

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:40.020
 And it's been 10 years of building this giant website with all kinds of stuff.

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.020
 Like visualizations, it's for statistics.

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:47.020
 There's all kinds of different custom visualizations for different sports and like tons of just

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:52.020
 UI that we would never want to rebuild on native app using native stuff, right?

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:58.020
 Like we are the perfect case for using web views to have a native mobile app because people

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.020
 constantly ask us for a native mobile app.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:03.020
 We want to say like, oh, the web, the mobile web experience is really good.

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:04.020
 Just use it on your phone.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.020
 It's fine.

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.020
 Like for the kind of site we have, it's like, it's fine.

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:12.020
 It's like a Wikipedia style, like lots of links clicking the pages, whatever.

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:16.020
 But people constantly badger us about having an app.

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:20.020
 Like every announcement we make, there's like five replies to the tweet that are like, we

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:21.020
 just want an app, bro.

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.020
 Like everybody wants a mobile app.

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:24.020
 So we're like, okay, fine.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:27.020
 We'll build a mobile app, but it's mostly going to be the web experience.

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.020
 You're just going to have a little bit of native like navigation at the bottom.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:30.020
 And that's basically it.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.020
 So it's all these web views.

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:39.020
 And I've talked to a few different like native development experts, if you will, and they've

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:42.020
 given me the green light that this is a case where, yeah, it probably makes sense.

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:43.020
 We're a small team.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:46.020
 Like we're not going to have a mobile developer that just does mobile development.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:48.020
 It probably makes sense to use web views.

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:49.020
 Like I've gotten the sign off.

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:52.020
 I'm not just like spitting in the face of every mobile developer.

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:56.020
 So we have this case where it makes sense, but it's just terrible.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:11:01.020
 It's such a terrible experience to build a native app using these web views.

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:05.660
 All the things you're used to doing in the web and sharing state and local storage and

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:11.020
 cookies and sessions, it all of it is just like, ask backwards and broken.

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:13.020
 And you can't do anything you want to do.

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:18.020
 The amount of like effort to build one little thing on the mobile app compared to the web,

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:19.020
 it's just insane.

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.020
 And I don't know if it's just because of our use case.

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:24.020
 We're trying to like shoehorn a web experience into a native app.

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.020
 That's why we're having such a hard time.

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:30.020
 Maybe if you're building like a purely native app and it's a totally different use case and

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:32.020
 it's not an existing property on the web.

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:34.020
 Maybe it's not this bad, but it's bad.

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:37.020
 And like the web view is like a community project.

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:42.020
 It's not like built in to react native used to be, I think, but then they spun it off and

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:43.020
 it's this community thing.

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:47.020
 The number of like quirky bugs for this being like, oh, it's cross platform.

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:49.020
 It works on Android and iOS.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:52.020
 The number of things that just don't work on Android or don't work on iOS.

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:55.020
 You can't use this flag on this, but you can on this.

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:56.020
 It's a mess.

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:57.020
 Okay.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:05.020
 Well, my question is does it makes like you guys use react native for this?

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:11.020
 What about those frameworks that are really more oriented around this web stuff?

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.020
 What are those frameworks?

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:13.020
 Are you going to say like flutter?

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:16.020
 In all these other words, I've heard people say and I've ignored for five years.

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:17.020
 No, not five years.

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:23.020
 Like before react native came out, there were all these like app development frameworks that

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:26.020
 were just around the idea of like shipping web views.

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:28.540
 But there's a bunch of them, right?

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:33.340
 Like I'm trying to remember my blanking on any of the names, but they, so react native

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:34.340
 is more oriented around.

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:38.260
 Oh, we're going to help you build a native app just in a different way.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.700
 So I can see why maybe doing web view stuff in there.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.940
 They just don't care that much about because the whole point of doing react native is to

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:46.980
 not do web stuff, I guess.

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:52.500
 I'm blanking on like, was it like capacitor capacitors that there was, there's like a

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.940
 bit, oh, ionic, ionic is one type of work.

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:56.940
 Okay.

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:57.940
 Yeah.

00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:58.940
 Why, why didn't you say this to me?

00:12:58.940 --> 00:12:59.940
 Like two months ago, Dax, three months ago.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.860
 Why are we just not talking about this?

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:02.860
 This is not good.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:07.140
 Then I'm realizing like, well, I asked some expert stacks and they said I could just use

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:11.900
 the web view and react native and then I realized I asked react native experts.

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.820
 Should I use a web view and react native?

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:14.820
 Yes.

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:17.980
 And maybe if I want to ask, should I use react native, they would have said, no.

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:18.980
 Oh man.

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:24.860
 I have to say, yes, anyway, yeah, probably a new way to build and ship from mobile.

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:25.860
 Oh my word.

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.900
 If this is better and easier and I just could have saved a lot of hair.

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:29.900
 Great.

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:30.900
 Again, I don't know anything about this.

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:36.740
 I've never used it, but positioning wise, it seems more related to like just straight

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:38.020
 up using a web view.

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.020
 Yeah.

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:45.620
 I don't know how that relates to literally just pointing to an existing web app, which

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:46.620
 is probably what you're doing, right?

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:47.620
 You're not even like.

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:48.620
 Yeah.

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:53.220
 So building from scratch, it's like literally hitting custom pages on our website that are

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:57.560
 kind of catered to this mobile experience, or in some cases, the same pages.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:01.980
 But I think that actually would still work because this is in JEX or in APIs and you can

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:02.980
 just access them.

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:03.980
 Yeah.

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:08.220
 Because I feel like if anyone has spent time figuring out the problem that you had, it's

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:12.900
 these people, which is because they're helping you build, ship a hybrid app or whatever.

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:14.060
 So I'm going to look into it.

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:19.580
 I do see on their website how you can also ship this ship to build apps across iOS, Android

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:20.580
 and the web.

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:21.580
 React Native does that too.

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:22.580
 Why would you build?

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:24.380
 Why in the world would you build a web app using React Native?

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.260
 I saw the craziest demo recently.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:27.460
 Oh, there's reasons to do it.

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:28.460
 It was cool.

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:29.460
 Okay.

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.020
 I mean, I can't share too much because I'm just going to blow up there.

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:32.020
 Mmm.

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:33.020
 It's one of those stuffs.

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:34.020
 It's one of those stuffs.

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:35.020
 But stealthy.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:36.420
 You got an inside tip kind of things.

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:37.420
 Yeah.

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:40.580
 It was a really cool bringing together of several technologies.

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:43.220
 One of them being React Native for web.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:48.380
 The reason being is you just want a single code base and you want to deploy the two,

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:49.380
 three platforms.

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:53.300
 I think in theory that's like, I can, I actually really considered it at one point for something

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:54.300
 I'm building.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:55.300
 Really?

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:56.860
 It doesn't just hamstring the web development so much.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:57.860
 Yeah.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:01.220
 But it depends on what you're building, if what you're building.

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:06.340
 So for you guys, it's like, stat Muse is like the golden property.

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:08.980
 And then this is like, it's like a side thing.

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:09.980
 Okay.

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:13.060
 So we're building a thing like, like, what was the famous app?

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:16.460
 Was it Snapchat or Instagram that didn't even have like a web experience?

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:19.260
 It was just mobile for the longest time.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.780
 They're like a huge billions of years or mobile.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:23.140
 Yeah, probably Snapchat, right?

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:24.580
 And I don't remember them doing web stuff.

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:27.140
 So maybe that case where the web is just kind of an afterthought.

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:28.140
 Yeah.

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:29.140
 Or like they're all equal.

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:30.140
 I don't know.

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:33.500
 I can see some productivity stuff being this case where you're equally excited to be able

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:38.860
 to use it on the go as, I don't know, like, I mean, this, the clock, this simple example

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:40.260
 was like a shopping list app.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:41.260
 Oh, I see.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.020
 That's like, you can see how like all three are kind of equal and it's not like you're

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:45.460
 going to be doing crazy web stuff.

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:46.460
 Yeah.

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:47.460
 Okay.

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:50.700
 I just can't imagine leaving behind things like next JS when I could build a website with

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:51.700
 next JS.

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:58.100
 That's just insane, but man, I can't wait for you guys to see this, this new thing.

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.340
 Next JS killer confirmed.

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:01.340
 Is that?

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:07.300
 No, it just, I think we're finally just rotating back to stuff that's actually useful, like

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:14.540
 yeah, I mean, it's, it's just like a great example of, again, using this react native

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:18.060
 for web thing and just having a single code base that works across all three plus a few

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:21.020
 other things that make it all nice.

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:24.540
 Can you give me a hint about who it's who's doing this?

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:25.540
 Is it someone we've heard of?

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:26.540
 I've heard of.

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:28.020
 I don't get how much.

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.020
 Yeah.

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:30.020
 Okay.

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:31.020
 Yeah.

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:32.020
 I'll tell you after.

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:33.020
 Okay.

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:38.420
 Let's look for the, the Patreon subscribers now.

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:39.420
 It's ready.

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:40.420
 Okay.

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:42.100
 So you've been working on this app and it sounds like it's been hell.

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:43.100
 Are you done?

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.420
 Do you feel like you're, I'm sure there's going to be a bunch of other issues.

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:50.980
 I mean, the first release, we already have like fast follow releases to and three planned.

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:52.980
 So such is life.

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:56.340
 Do you feel like you'll ever just like be cool?

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:58.500
 Just like, I'm cool with the pace things are going.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.500
 I mean, cool.

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:00.500
 Cool.

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.980
 But like my wife is like, why, why do you get so?

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:04.940
 You'll like into each release.

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:08.220
 Why do you push so hard to get this thing out the door when you just have more stuff

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:09.220
 to do after that?

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:10.220
 It's not like I'm just done.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:14.140
 So like, why can't I just take a nice, easy pace and just be like, I get done what I get

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:15.440
 done every day.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.440
 Life is good.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.540
 I enjoy where I'm at in life.

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:19.660
 Why can't I just be that way?

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:23.300
 I think I have, I think I flip between those two modes.

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:24.300
 Really?

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:25.300
 Yeah.

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:29.340
 Cause if you look at, I mean, if I think about SSD right now, we're definitely in the, so

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:35.100
 we call it like dummy mode, it's like, it's a, cause like we don't, the phase we're in

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:37.220
 right now, we don't have to use our brains too much.

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:39.940
 We spent like six months building ion.

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:44.820
 And that was like a lot of like kind of what you're talking about, like, you know, focused

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:47.020
 effort and like, you know, pushing.

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:50.300
 But now we've like done all the thinking.

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:53.300
 And now every day we wake up, there's a bunch of issues.

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:57.980
 We just fix them one by one and they're all like pretty straightforward, bugs, new features,

00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:58.980
 whatever.

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.860
 Like we don't have to, like the order we do them doesn't matter.

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:04.800
 Like we're just totally reactive and we just have to do everything.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:10.940
 And if we do this for six months, we'll look back and I'll be like a very polished product

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:12.140
 with a lot of stuff.

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:17.300
 So it feels more relaxed in that I'm not like having all these existential questions of

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:18.300
 like, who are we?

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:19.380
 What are what we want to do?

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:20.380
 You know?

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:21.380
 Yeah.

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:22.380
 I feel that shifts.

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:23.380
 So I don't feel like I'm always in.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:24.380
 Yeah.

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:25.380
 I'm not always.

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.620
 I guess I go through, it's all about the like release calendar.

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:32.040
 Like if we have a target day, like we're trying to get something out for a certain time frame,

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:35.580
 then the closer it gets that time frame, the more stress, the more I push.

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:39.340
 And then after that, I'll go through a few weeks where I'm like, it's the beginning of

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:41.260
 every new phase is like pretty chill.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:45.340
 Like I'm still getting stuff done, but it's just like, I'm not freaking out every day.

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:48.100
 Like I'm, I got to get this done.

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:52.300
 That's probably normal, I guess, I think is like, we don't really have releases like

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:53.300
 that.

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:56.580
 Like, you're just, you're just always continuously releasing.

00:18:56.580 --> 00:19:00.620
 C I C D. C I C D. Yeah.

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:04.660
 You shipped a production like 15 times a day, you don't even think about it anymore.

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:05.660
 Twice.

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:09.940
 Well, it's easy for us because the thing we release is a CLI, which is version.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:13.700
 So like, if it's broken and it's fine, just go back to the previous version.

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:14.700
 Yeah.

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:15.700
 Web apps, not so much.

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:18.140
 When you release the web app, everyone gets the web app.

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:19.140
 Yeah.

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:20.140
 So that's kind of nice.

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:23.220
 I just finished and I just run one command and it's out and I don't really think about

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:24.220
 anything.

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:25.220
 It breaks.

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:26.220
 I'll just do another one.

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.220
 Yeah.

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:33.700
 It's just different, but I do think that we do have moments where we're like doing a

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:37.860
 more like release oriented thing and it is good because it kind of forced us to go faster

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:41.980
 than we normally would or like, like there's a good impact to that.

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:44.100
 I just don't think we can be in like that all the time.

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.700
 No, can't be like that.

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:50.300
 It always, but it feels like to me and to my family when we're in the thick of it, it

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:51.860
 feels like this is how it always is.

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:55.620
 Like I got to chill out because this is always, we're always pushing, but then we're not.

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:58.400
 We forget when we come off of it.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:00.980
 There are periods of relative chill.

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:08.780
 Speaking of relative chill, did you see relative chill at home, did you see Amazon return to

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:09.780
 office thing?

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:10.780
 Oh, I did.

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:13.740
 And a bunch of people, I saw people leave like big names.

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:14.740
 Chris Nunn's left.

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:19.580
 I saw other big names people announce they're leaving AWS.

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:20.580
 Is that all over the RTO?

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:23.780
 I actually saw the people say they were leaving before I saw the return.

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:25.660
 Yeah, so I don't know how related it is.

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:29.340
 I mean, they've been bleeding people for a while, so yeah, much, much big continuation

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:30.340
 of that.

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:36.660
 But yeah, I think they said officially backed five days in the office and everyone's really

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:38.620
 angry and has a lot of discussion going on about it.

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:40.380
 Do you know what it was before that?

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:41.380
 Three.

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:43.100
 But like, so you had to live in Seattle.

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:47.220
 You had to be near an office three days in your hub.

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:52.460
 And now it's you have to be where your team is, which is likely not, or not where you

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:53.460
 live.

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:57.660
 Oh, so lots of people are having to go back to Seattle potentially, like where their

00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:58.660
 team existing.

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:01.060
 They got to commute.

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:02.460
 That sucks.

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:06.620
 I mean, for them, I would never work at a place where I had to live somewhere specific.

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:10.700
 15 years now, nobody's telling me where to live at this point.

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:11.700
 Yeah.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:15.740
 I'm totally on the evil side of this, like everyone's going to hate my thoughts on this.

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:16.740
 Oh, you think it's good.

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:19.540
 I saw your, I saw your contrarian take.

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:22.820
 When I see it takes like that, when you say stuff like that, I just think like, do you

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:23.820
 really believe that?

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:26.220
 Or you just want to be the opposite of what everyone else is saying?

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:27.220
 Is it both?

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:28.460
 No, I've been annoyed by this forever.

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:33.780
 And a lot of it is like personal and irrational, but I do think I also have a rational case.

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:36.420
 Like you, I've worked mostly remote my whole career.

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:42.620
 A lot of time was as a consultant, I've seen a lot of companies, almost none of them do

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:43.620
 remote well.

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:46.100
 And almost none of them do remote well, that makes sense.

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:48.340
 I will only ever work for remote companies.

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:54.380
 So I'm willing to, you know, sacrifice the ability to work at a lot of these places that,

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:57.180
 you know, pay a lot because they require to be in the office and that's been my position

00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:58.340
 for a long time.

00:21:58.340 --> 00:21:59.340
 Yep.

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:05.420
 I don't think a company like Amazon that never intended to be remote, that kind of offered

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:10.740
 this very stable, straightforward path of like making a lot of money.

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:14.860
 I can see why them just flipping to remote overnight doesn't work out.

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:15.860
 Yeah.

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:16.860
 Right.

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:19.580
 When I was like, a lot of these companies, like the motivation isn't very high than the

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:24.660
 relationship is, how do I do the least amount of work while still getting what I need?

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:28.220
 And there's a contention and that's like, at these big companies, that's kind of how

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:29.220
 it is.

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:32.900
 I think when you go to remote overnight, it just swings really hard in one way.

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:36.140
 And they probably, did they do it in 2020, did they do the COVID?

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:37.140
 Is that why?

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:38.140
 Yeah.

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:39.140
 It was all because of COVID.

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:40.140
 Uh huh.

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:43.340
 And there's like, there's different people at fault for that, like some of it's a company,

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:47.780
 some of it's a people that are working there, but they're like, just like my employees.

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:52.660
 But the arguments that people make of why Amazon is doing this, they're not very good.

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:55.300
 They're like, weird conspiracy theories.

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:59.100
 I'm sure some of it is because they get to like, it's like a free layoff, like, it's

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:03.180
 a way to pay back your workforce, like make some cuts with that.

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:04.780
 I don't like that.

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:09.540
 I'm not going to say that's not a case, but it's like a random layoff and like, yeah,

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:14.020
 being willing to just like randomly lose people is like, it's kind of a stretch.

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:17.500
 I think, but I acknowledge, okay, maybe that that is there somewhere.

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:21.940
 I've definitely seen the extreme, uh, conspiracy theories, like commercial real estate, like

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:26.180
 somehow they're in coats, like it's like, it's, it's, it's not that.

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:27.180
 It's like if that.

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:28.180
 Yeah.

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:31.660
 So when people start talking like that, I know like, you just want, you just like got

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:33.780
 remote for free and you like don't really want to fight for it.

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:36.300
 And you want to have some like thing to complain for.

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:40.460
 If you really want to work remote and you care about that, quit and go find a place,

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:45.020
 like be good enough to go find a place that is like, hell yeah, why are you?

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:49.340
 And this just refers back to how it used to be, which is I were for a bunch of companies

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:50.620
 that were not remote.

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:55.060
 I went and I interviewed and I got them really excited about me, then I had to negotiate

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:57.260
 letting me promote.

00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:58.460
 And that was hard and annoying.

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:02.380
 And oftentimes it was a no, but yeah, you can still pull it off if like you really care

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:03.380
 about it.

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:04.380
 Yeah.

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:07.940
 So that's one side, I mean, that's like the personal side where I'm just like, I just

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:12.100
 find the complaints around as annoying, like you care about it, like you can make it happen.

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:13.100
 Right?

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:14.100
 Yeah.

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:15.100
 Yeah.

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:20.620
 Then the other side is, I think Amazon is just needs to reset, like, I think any kind

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:23.980
 of big change is probably going to be good for them, like especially AWS.

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:28.060
 If we look back over the last four or five years, like, I feel like things have been kind

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:29.060
 of different.

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:31.940
 Like they haven't really shipped as much like they really seem to be lagging.

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:35.780
 It's like this, there's just like a lack of cohesion and they're like falling behind in

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:36.780
 a bunch of places.

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:39.060
 So any kind of reset for them, I think would be good.

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:42.060
 Yes, that means losing a bunch of good people and there's going to be pain in the short

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:43.060
 term.

00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:48.860
 But I think that will be just, I just think that's probably good for them.

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:50.940
 They probably way over hired during COVID.

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:51.940
 That was definitely a thing.

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:52.940
 Yeah.

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:58.020
 Cause like the internet usage kind of soared during COVID, right?

00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:00.420
 So internet companies may be over hired or no.

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:01.420
 Yeah.

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:06.220
 So it was also just money was cheap too and free flowing, so like, I'm sure like any

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:10.500
 decision that, you know, there's a 20% chance of make the decision and it probably turns

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:16.420
 like an 80% chance and it just, yeah, bloated everything and yeah, that's why you have this

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:17.420
 nice cushy job.

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:18.420
 It's because of that over hiring.

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:21.660
 So at some point, there's going to be a correction.

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:26.700
 Do you have any opinions on whether the, you said the last few years that AWS has kind

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:31.180
 of been falling behind and just like kind of a mess, a drift, do you think it lines up

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:32.380
 with Jassy leaving?

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:36.340
 Like I had Slipsky in there and then now this new guy, like do you think it's a leadership

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:38.260
 problem or just random and who cares?

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:39.260
 I have no idea.

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:40.860
 Cause I just don't know any of the details.

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:41.860
 Yeah.

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:44.060
 I do wonder if Jassy was really good at everything.

00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:46.820
 I mean, he's now the Amazon CEO, right?

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:47.820
 Yeah.

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:48.820
 So it must be really good at everything.

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:49.820
 Yeah.

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:53.060
 Again, I don't know if it was, if it's like, I just don't know, like they might just be

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:57.060
 at a certain, maybe they're sort of making money too easily, like that's also like a

00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:58.860
 weird dynamic that that's just stuff.

00:25:58.860 --> 00:25:59.860
 Yeah.

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:00.860
 You don't have to fight for it anymore.

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:05.180
 Just kind of like getting fat and happy and yeah, they're making a hundred billion dollars

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:06.340
 revenue a year.

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:07.340
 It's still growing.

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:09.540
 Like that's pretty outrageous numbers.

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:14.340
 When you say they fall in behind, you think, are you talking like, like the cloud flares

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:20.700
 of the world, like in the serverless kind of ways, like the new edge or new era app development

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:24.420
 ways or what kind of things come to your mind when you say it, if this is fun behind.

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:27.580
 Because I would say they think they fall in behind on a AI.

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:31.820
 And so they've hard pivoted to everything about AI they can possibly do.

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:32.820
 Yeah.

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:33.820
 No, but that is it.

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:34.820
 That actually is true.

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:38.980
 Like why like they should be leading AI really.

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:43.420
 I don't think they need to reorient their whole business around it, but like, yeah, it

00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:44.420
 is weird.

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:45.420
 They just were completely caught.

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:46.420
 Yeah.

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:47.420
 I just don't see them.

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:48.420
 Same way that Apple too.

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:49.420
 Yeah.

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:50.420
 A lot of the big companies.

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:51.420
 Yeah.

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:54.820
 I mean, I just don't see them leading, you know, in a lot of places in terms of like pushing

00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:59.500
 how we do things, like, you know, pushing the bar on that they're not like lowering prices

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:00.940
 as much as they used to.

00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:04.600
 They're not like, didn't they have didn't actually raise prices on something like the

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:05.600
 first time.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:10.460
 The first time ever they raised something I can't remember what it was inflation.

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:11.460
 Yeah.

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:12.460
 I'm just even getting the big things.

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:13.460
 Sorry.

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:17.860
 I'm just not feeling that thing I'm looking for where I'm like, Oh yeah, there's a lot

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:22.900
 of energy here and pushing and they're thinking about, you know, disrupting their own products

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:23.900
 and all that.

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:24.900
 There are like exceptions.

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:27.980
 I do think there's some stuff coming out that is going to be interesting, but it's

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:31.740
 been a couple of reinvents that were kind of underwhelming, like a couple of years of

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:36.060
 like, I don't know, I didn't leave reinvent being like, man, life is just going to keep

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:37.060
 getting better.

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:38.060
 Yeah, exactly.

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:42.540
 So I just think they need to reset whatever big disruption they need to do is probably

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:43.540
 good.

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:44.540
 Yeah.

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:48.340
 So I guess I always thought, well, I start my career mode as well.

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:52.860
 And I always thought like, especially leading up when the COVID stuff happened and everybody,

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:56.260
 it was like, oh, it's accelerating the transfer to all of us being remote.

00:27:56.260 --> 00:28:00.340
 I had this assumption that it was like better and that over time, more and more people would

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:02.020
 work from home.

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:05.260
 And I think what you're saying is, is reminding me, that's not true.

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:06.260
 Like it's not for everybody.

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:07.940
 It's not for every company.

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:12.340
 And it seemed like all the articles came out when COVID hit that like, this is just going

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:16.220
 to accelerate the work from home movement and everyone's going to be remote in five

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:17.920
 years.

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:21.820
 And turns out everyone's being sent back to the office five years later.

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:25.460
 Yeah, it's going back to where it used to be, which is if you can get a company really,

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:27.660
 really excited about you, they'll still let you work remote.

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:30.940
 And if it's the right kind of company, like to your point, an Amazon probably doesn't

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:34.300
 make sense to be a largely remote workforce.

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:35.740
 It's like, is it just big companies?

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:40.380
 Is it just like when you're a company at Amazon scale, is it just harder to be remote?

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:42.860
 If you didn't, I guess, like you said, if you didn't start, we're not okay.

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:46.940
 So I'll give you like the dynamics because our team is remote.

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:47.940
 You're three people.

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:52.740
 What that decks and Amazon's about what three million people I don't know.

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:53.740
 Yeah.

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:57.660
 Well, I think if I explain dynamics, I could actually clearly explain why, like, yeah.

00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:00.780
 It's going to be extra hard for a company like Amazon.

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:10.060
 When we work remote, what that looks like is work infiltrates way more of our life because

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:13.340
 we don't have clock in, clock out.

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:16.780
 We message each other all kinds of day, like time, like we're working out with like it

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:22.220
 just, it, we really let it take over way more of our life than we normally would.

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:27.620
 So weirdly for us, working remote means we're like working a lot more and we're more engaged.

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:31.220
 But that's built on the idea of all of us being extremely motivated because we're, this

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:32.220
 is like our company.

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:33.220
 Yeah.

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:34.220
 Right.

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:35.220
 Like we're all innately.

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:36.220
 You got steak.

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:37.940
 100x more motivated than I tried to explain this to Casey the other day.

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:41.340
 I still am having this conversation with Casey about how I don't just have a normal job.

00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:45.300
 Like I have skin in the game, I have a steak and everything I work on.

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:46.300
 You know what I mean?

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:48.260
 And it's beyond just like a financial stake.

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:50.700
 It's like, it's like a, it's like a part of identity.

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:51.700
 Right.

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:52.700
 Yeah.

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:53.700
 Oh, yeah.

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:57.180
 I'm sure we have hopes and dreams for it outside of financial success.

00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:58.340
 So we're extremely motivated.

00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:02.980
 So when we work remote, it just like, it's like super charges how much, you know, it like

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:04.620
 infiltrates our lives.

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:10.420
 Now if you remove the motivation, I think you have the opposite problem, which is now

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:15.500
 it's very easy to like not do that, like not really do as much work.

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:16.500
 Yeah.

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:17.500
 Yeah.

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:18.500
 Yeah.

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:21.660
 So at these, I mean, a side effect of being large is it's really hard to motivate your

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:22.660
 workforce.

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:23.660
 Yeah.

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:26.780
 So yeah, I can see why they struggle with that.

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:31.260
 Do they just know like in leadership at big companies, they just know that like ultimately

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:34.980
 we get like 10% of an employees effort that they would be giving it a startup.

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:38.060
 But if we have a million of them, that's enough.

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:39.060
 Yeah.

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:40.060
 Everyone like lies to themselves.

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:42.420
 And it like, you know, that thing that like work always inflates the time you have.

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:45.640
 So it always feels like everyone's doing as much as they possibly can.

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:49.900
 So this is what like when they talk about corporate culture and like principles and

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:52.460
 all this stuff, it's to like basically it's religion.

00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:58.380
 You're trying to like brainwash everyone under you to like just to get that 10% out of them

00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:01.940
 so that everyone's not just completely checked out doing nothing.

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:05.300
 Is that the idea or the money is the motivator?

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:06.300
 Sorry.

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:07.300
 I'm answering my own question.

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:11.020
 I remember when I was young, I remember my dad saying that, yeah, if you have someone

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:15.420
 in the office and they spend 40% of their time working, that's like very good.

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:18.900
 That's like, you should be really happy with that.

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:20.620
 And so yeah, I think it just accepted.

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:24.900
 There's just like, there's always going to be like this tension of one party trying to

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:28.380
 get as much out of it, the other party trying to get as little trying to put as little work

00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:31.420
 out there as possible and like you arrive at some middle ground.

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:37.140
 It's so foreign being a startup founder and like you, we've just only worked for ourselves

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:38.540
 on things for ourselves.

00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:43.820
 We work 100% of the time and then like cut into our life sometimes to work more because

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:45.780
 the thing needs more attention.

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:49.980
 Like there's no moment in my, or is it like comms and stuff?

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:55.260
 Are they just saying like the 40% doesn't include like all the wasted time like breaks

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:57.820
 and communication and meetings?

00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:58.820
 Yeah.

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:03.220
 Whatever it is, like it's just there's like room for, there's like wiggle room for you

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:05.940
 to like do more or less and I think that's, that's kind of what I'm not saying.

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:06.940
 Yeah.

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:08.380
 But do you feel like you spend 100% of your time working?

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:14.260
 Like I feel like, well, no, but I think the difference is there's no one for me to scan,

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:18.820
 you know, back when I was more in consulting, yeah, I was playing that game of like, how

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:21.100
 can I build the most hours with the least amount of work?

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:22.100
 Of course.

00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:23.100
 Like a natural incentive.

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:24.100
 Yeah.

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:25.100
 But it's like eating sugar.

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:26.100
 Like the customer.

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:27.100
 You're trying to be the most efficient.

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:31.340
 Your body's just trying to get the most dense thing for the least effort.

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:32.340
 Yeah.

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:33.820
 And that's just a natural state of things.

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:37.660
 But now when you're doing your own thing, there's no one to like, there's no one to

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:38.660
 scan.

00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:39.660
 Pull that off.

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:41.460
 You know, you're just going to get your scamming yourself.

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:42.460
 Yeah.

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:44.100
 All that stuff just goes away.

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:45.100
 Yeah.

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:48.660
 I just, I can't imagine like only spending 40% of my day.

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:54.420
 Like moving things forward, whatever work is like, that must be nice, I guess, is what

00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:58.500
 I would say, working for other people and just clocking in and clocking out or parts

00:32:58.500 --> 00:32:59.500
 that are nice.

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:00.500
 Yeah.

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:01.500
 That's a trade off.

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:05.420
 Like you have to do that and then you lose a bunch of other stuff, but, uh, but that's

00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:10.740
 kind of why I don't like this whole, it feels entitled for people to be like, no, we should

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:11.740
 let us work remote.

00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:16.420
 It's like, you're trying to have everything like you can't, you can't have an easy job

00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:20.900
 and have like the exact type of life you want to just cab everything.

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:22.180
 It's so true.

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:28.460
 And it like especially, like I especially don't care because like these are engineers

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:33.620
 at Amazon, like you're not, you're making an increasing amount of money or this stuff

00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:38.460
 and to be like, right, to have like this like weird, like pet, like moral pedestal you were

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:42.420
 standing on about like working remote, like, yeah, it does get kind of moral, doesn't it?

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:47.540
 Like people start like attacking the company, like they just committed a hate crime.

00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:53.500
 I mean, it's like, how dare they also at the company is just made of employees like you

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:54.740
 that are making these decisions.

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:55.740
 Yeah.

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:56.740
 Right.

00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:57.740
 It's your peers.

00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:58.740
 Ultimately.

00:33:58.740 --> 00:33:59.740
 Yeah.

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:00.740
 Like it's the decision.

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:01.740
 Yeah.

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:03.700
 So, you know, it just, I have little that it like just draws a little empathy from me because

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:07.100
 like these are like, this is like a very privileged category of people.

00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:10.180
 Like I don't really care about this struggle, you know?

00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:14.740
 So this podcast is long enough now like two, two years, no, how long have we been doing

00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:16.860
 this two years almost two years?

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:17.860
 That's crazy.

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:22.540
 I'm getting distracted by my, my qualifier at the beginning of this statement.

00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:26.260
 It's long enough now, but I feel like we should check in every once in a while on the cycle.

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:27.260
 Where are we at?

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:31.020
 I've asked you this probably in the last three months, but like have things come off

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:36.980
 of the quantitative easing interest or zero interest rate era, like has the collapse from

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:37.980
 all that come yet?

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:38.980
 Or is it still waiting?

00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:39.980
 Are we still pending?

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:40.980
 Yeah.

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:41.980
 I have no idea.

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:42.980
 Well, they just cut rates yesterday, officially.

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:43.980
 Oh, they did.

00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:44.980
 0.5.

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:45.980
 That's something.

00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:46.980
 Yeah.

00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:51.140
 So was it priced in or did the market just for a little bit just finally go down a little

00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:52.140
 bit?

00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:53.140
 Yeah.

00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:54.140
 No kidding.

00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:57.980
 Did the, did the market like blow up and go up a thousand points in?

00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:04.700
 But it's so like, to me, it's a lot like, you know, how like comedies be straight forward

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:08.500
 and like we even that did sarcasm, then we went to like double sarcasm and then triple

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:09.500
 sarcasm.

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:11.140
 Everything is like so, so layered now.

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:12.140
 Yeah.

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:13.940
 It feels that way with the market also.

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:18.500
 It's like that news is good news, but then no, we go back to good news is good news and

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:22.940
 now back to that, you know, it just keeps looking because it's like, yeah, the possibility

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:29.420
 of a rate cut causes prices to go up because we're excited that money is big as they thought

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:30.420
 it'd be crashing.

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:34.500
 When it just happens, now the possibility is gone, so everyone's cashing into the prices

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:35.500
 go down.

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:38.700
 It's just like, but like that can circle like wrap around again.

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:43.420
 So yeah, the market is so untethered from events forgetting about the market, then how

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:50.020
 do you feel about like the economy, capital E, you know, the economy, mostly in the tech

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:51.020
 world?

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:52.020
 I don't care about it.

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:55.380
 I mean, I do, but I don't all this stuff is just so funny because the technical problem

00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:58.100
 we've had is that our economy is too good.

00:35:58.100 --> 00:35:59.100
 Mm.

00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:03.140
 Like that's the problem we've had over the last couple of years and it's it's easy for

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:06.620
 people to like forget that because we always talk about it in a negative way.

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:07.620
 I never knew that.

00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:08.620
 Could you please explain?

00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:09.620
 It's too good.

00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:14.380
 Well, like why is inflation high is because there's a lot of money is because unemployment

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:15.380
 is low.

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:19.780
 It's because people are making a lot of money and spending a lot of it and it's outpacing

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:20.780
 our supply.

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:21.780
 So what's wrong with inflation?

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:27.620
 Well, if you haven't overheated economy, I mean, the problem is like you can exhaust

00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:30.900
 like, okay, the root problem is we don't have enough stuff.

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:31.900
 That's the root problem.

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:36.300
 Oh, we don't have enough stuff for the amount of people that can on paper afford it.

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:39.820
 So what the Fed has been trying to do for the past couple of years is actually make

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:45.660
 our economy worse on purpose by making money less available by like targeting an increase.

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:46.820
 This is what's so funny.

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:51.340
 Like the president will always like tell unemployment numbers, he'll be like, Oh, unemployment is

00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:52.340
 like every month.

00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:53.340
 Yeah.

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:57.180
 President is like record low unemployment, but on the flip side, the Fed is like, fuck,

00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:58.180
 it's too low.

00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:02.780
 They're trying to like increase it, you know, they're trying to increase unemployment.

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:07.380
 So yeah, so the Fed is trying to lower the amount of consumption that's happening.

00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:13.380
 So we can either get smoother transition while like these supply gaps are fixed.

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:14.380
 Okay.

00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:15.380
 And that's the state.

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:16.380
 We've been it.

00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:20.300
 And it's been exaggerated in tech because, you know, that's where all like the future

00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:22.260
 facing investment goes in.

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:28.060
 So when the Fed slows down tries to like make the economy less overheated, the most overheated

00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:32.260
 places have a drastic, you know, reaction.

00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:33.260
 Why?

00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:34.260
 Okay.

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:35.260
 We can't just let it.

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:36.260
 I feel so dumb.

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:37.700
 This is so hard for me to track.

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:44.460
 They can't just let it keep overheating to infinity because we don't have enough stuff

00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:45.460
 to consume.

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:46.460
 Yeah.

00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:47.460
 And it's kind of like climate change.

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:49.780
 There's like a run, there's like runaway effects and feedback loops and you start to

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:52.260
 get into hyperinflation, which is like not recoverable.

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:53.260
 Okay.

00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:54.260
 Oh, I've heard of this.

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:55.540
 That's happened in some countries, right?

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:57.860
 They want like a smoother transition.

00:37:57.860 --> 00:37:58.860
 That's what their goal has been.

00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:06.020
 With their transition to just normal flation, not inflated, not deflated, just flation.

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:12.220
 We just want a plain old garden variety flation regular online.

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:13.220
 Exactly.

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:14.220
 Okay.

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:15.220
 Yeah.

00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:16.220
 So it's weird.

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:20.020
 So the past couple of years, we're like, you know, jobs with like the tech where like

00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:23.220
 people are making less money and like there's less jobs and it's all this like negative

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:24.740
 economic sentiment.

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:28.300
 The actual problem is that it's, uh, it was overheated.

00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:32.540
 So when you say a smooth transition, it's, if they don't do anything, it'll be a crash

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:33.540
 transition.

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:37.140
 It'll like fall to a deflated state or something.

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:40.820
 I mean, they're concerned about hyperinflation, which is there's like historical examples

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:42.980
 of what that are actually concerned about it.

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:43.980
 Okay.

00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:44.980
 That was a concern.

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:45.980
 Yeah.

00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:46.980
 I mean, we did print a lot of money.

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:49.740
 So we need to like let the economy absorb that slowly.

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:51.740
 Okay.

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:52.740
 Is it working?

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:54.060
 Are they taking steps that are working?

00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:55.060
 Yes.

00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:56.060
 It's surprising.

00:38:56.060 --> 00:39:01.180
 But I think I've always felt like interventions were very ineffective or like had second order

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:05.740
 effects and it's kind of hard to, you know, like intervene in a complex system like this,

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:11.620
 but it feels like the Fed like kind of orchestrated it pretty well.

00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:16.980
 Like inflation is come is has is now down to where the goals are.

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:18.740
 We didn't have like this runaway thing.

00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:19.740
 Really?

00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:22.940
 Again, hard to say it was literally exactly what they did.

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:27.020
 But yeah, I mean, we all feel bad about the tech sector, but like, what are we comparing

00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:28.020
 it to?

00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:30.940
 Like comparing it to like a hyperinflated 2020 2021 state.

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:32.180
 Wait, what do we feel bad about?

00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:33.180
 We feel bad about the tech sector?

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:34.180
 I didn't feel bad.

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:35.980
 So I want to know what everyone else feels bad about that I missed.

00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:41.460
 No, we're like, Oh, there's less jobs and like, you know, like we people aren't able

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:45.620
 to make as much money, but it's all relative to like this overheated state.

00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:48.140
 So yeah, I don't know.

00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:49.580
 So I don't know where anything's going.

00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:55.100
 I, I just feel like whatever state we were in a couple of years ago, I don't we've had

00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:56.100
 a contraction.

00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:58.820
 I don't know if it's going to keep going.

00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:03.020
 I don't see how it gets back to that, that state that originally, yeah, if you're in

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:08.900
 the top X percent of people in this industry, it largely doesn't affect you.

00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:09.900
 Yeah.

00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:10.900
 Yeah.

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:11.900
 Okay.

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:12.900
 Yeah.

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:16.940
 So I want to I want to talk about what you've been up to on Twitter because I've literally

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:20.580
 been on so little that I haven't seen your 30 tweets today, because you just like tell

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:24.540
 me some of the bangers, like what's been going on, or just what's going on with our friends.

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:25.540
 Just catch me up.

00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:26.540
 I don't know.

00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:27.540
 Are you just like done?

00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:28.540
 You're just not going to come back.

00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:32.980
 It's kind of to be honest, it's kind of nice to just like wake up and program and then be

00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:38.900
 done and then wake up and program and like not think about the internet and all that's

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:40.220
 going on on Twitter or whatever.

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:44.340
 Like I haven't thought about what's happening on Twitter and I don't know how long until

00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:48.380
 just now, which I would like to hear from you, you know, is there anything I've missed

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:49.380
 that was really fun?

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:54.300
 No, it's just the same old, same old stuff, you know, prime and teach had DHH on just copy

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:55.300
 on us.

00:40:55.300 --> 00:41:03.660
 Now DHH has officially done the terminal tour clean sleep, both podcasts.

00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:05.660
 I called him a moron yesterday.

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:07.100
 Who DHH or Brian?

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:08.100
 Yeah.

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:09.100
 No DHH.

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:10.100
 Do you change a moron?

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:11.100
 What for?

00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:15.620
 He was like DHH was like, man, these YouTube comments are really nice.

00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:19.140
 Usually there's people that, you know, reply calling me a moron.

00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:20.780
 That's what replied to him.

00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:21.780
 Moron.

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:22.780
 Moron.

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:23.780
 That's a good one.

00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:27.300
 Which, you know, that wasn't the first time I had a single word tweet that said moron.

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:28.300
 I searched my history.

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:31.700
 I think I've done it before and I've had a bunch of them and they probably weren't inviting

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:32.700
 it the other time.

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:33.700
 No, no, no.

00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:34.700
 Yeah.

00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:35.700
 Moron replied.

00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:36.700
 I think it was really good.

00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:37.700
 It's just the same old.

00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:42.080
 Yeah, there was just funny thing I saw yesterday, which I loved.

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:45.420
 So you know how postmark, I don't know if you've ever been following all this postmark stuff,

00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:46.820
 but they got acquired a bit ago.

00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:47.820
 What's the email?

00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:48.820
 Yeah.

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:52.220
 They had like some pretty crazy downtime and it's, it seems like a result of they got acquired

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:57.820
 and like companies been like stripped down and it's just not a good product anymore.

00:41:57.820 --> 00:42:03.580
 And the recent CEO like replies, replied to them being like, or like there's some like

00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:05.620
 postmark downtime thing.

00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:09.780
 And the recent CEO replied being like, switch over recent blah, blah, blah, and he like

00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:11.780
 links to something.

00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:13.580
 He's like, just going to drop this here.

00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:17.340
 Then Wes boss replies being like, well, if you're just going to drop that there, you should

00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:21.260
 also drop this there, which is like all of recent's downtime issues.

00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:26.060
 Because a recent was a game that's chasing basically like being like postmarkers down

00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:30.700
 use us, but then recent is like a crazy amount of downtime, including stuff they haven't even

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:31.700
 like officially written out.

00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:34.300
 Like there was one thing from a couple of weeks ago.

00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:39.820
 I have grown to really dislike recent and that company in general.

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:44.740
 They are just yet another company that are just spending stupid amounts of money on stuff

00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:45.740
 that's irrelevant.

00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:52.100
 And at the end of the day, they're just building yet another rapper of SES like this is really

00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:56.740
 an interesting conversation right now, the just the multiple angles.

00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:58.780
 It's so interesting.

00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:01.180
 It's like you go and you're like, I'm going to found a company.

00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:06.060
 This is like a very big decision in your life, like it's your career, you decided it's going

00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:07.060
 to be a venture scale thing.

00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:09.020
 Again, another big decision.

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:12.500
 If it works out, you're going to spend the next 10 years of your life working on this

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:13.500
 thing.

00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:17.700
 And you're like, I'm going to build a thing that sends email.

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:20.260
 That's like what you're going to do of all that.

00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:27.460
 And to me, it's just like what a waste of resources, effort, whatever.

00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:31.220
 And it's just, you know, people have done this before, there's a million email things

00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:35.300
 like, yeah, just because you like wrap it in this fancy design, they have this like philosophy

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:41.100
 page about their like this like really pretentious design, like these are philosophy on like

00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:42.180
 products in life.

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:44.820
 And like we believe that documentation should be good.

00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:49.620
 And we believe that they have a whole section on how they're like, uptime should be like

00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:50.620
 water.

00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:52.500
 Like just like crazy shit like that.

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:55.900
 It's funny to have that section when like they've literally had the worst downtime I've

00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:56.900
 seen.

00:43:56.900 --> 00:44:00.780
 And I'm going to defend this person because I love Dracula.

00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:02.420
 I use it on everything.

00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:08.560
 It's my keyboard theme, like my physical keycaps Dracula made Dracula, he did.

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:09.560
 Is it dark?

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:11.420
 You are a Dracula, Dracula, Dracula.

00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:12.420
 Okay.

00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:13.420
 Yeah.

00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:14.420
 Just going to defend him for that reason.

00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:15.420
 That's fine.

00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:16.780
 Because he wants to buy some terminal coffee for his team.

00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:17.780
 You know what?

00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:18.780
 Maybe we could do a Dracula coffee.

00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:21.220
 I would love to do this actually just to spite you.

00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:27.900
 We do a Dracula themed terminal coffee partnership with your favorite CEO.

00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:35.540
 I'm just like, it's the product.

00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:36.540
 Yeah.

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:37.540
 Yeah.

00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:38.540
 It's kind of like, I'm just tired.

00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:39.540
 Like this playbook.

00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:40.540
 Yeah.

00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:41.540
 Yeah.

00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:42.540
 That's not the only start.

00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:50.300
 There's a lot of startups doing similar, like low, it's like not having your sides high,

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:56.020
 like kind of aiming for medium outcomes and like doing the whole startup thing.

00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:57.020
 Yeah.

00:44:57.020 --> 00:44:58.180
 It's just like, and then it just creates a ton of noise.

00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:02.820
 So the other thing is going back to their downtime, the last downtime was because their

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:06.900
 AWS account, I'm going to actually make a quick little short about this later because

00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:09.260
 I've been trying to figure out how to explain this.

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:16.060
 So their last downtime was because their SES sending got banned in US East 1, which gives

00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:19.900
 you the hint that they just have a single AWS account and they put all their customers

00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:24.940
 in there, which if you are trying to be an infrastructure provider, I hope you at least

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:28.620
 understand why you should just use a single AWS account for this reason.

00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:38.140
 But this brings up like a more root problem, which is AWS built a one giant system and

00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:40.220
 they solve the multi tenant problem.

00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:42.100
 You can go sign up for AWS.

00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:44.140
 You can use a bunch of resources.

00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:49.420
 It's okay if somebody else is also using AWS and they use it for something sketchy, what

00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:52.020
 they like, have a ton of traffic, it doesn't affect you.

00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:57.020
 They have built a multi tenant system, which means a lot of work and they solve that problem.

00:45:57.020 --> 00:46:01.540
 Then you have these middlemen come in where they sign up for one AWS account and they put

00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:05.460
 all their customers in it and all of a sudden all these problems come back.

00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:09.940
 It's like, I'm assuming their stuff got blocked because one recent customer did something crazy

00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:14.500
 and it affected all of them and they'll spend the next six months like fixing this problem

00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:18.020
 that was already fixed and they're right a bunch of blog posts about, hey, we've solved

00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:19.020
 all this crazy stuff for you.

00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:22.980
 It's like no, you just, it just was already solved like this wasn't a problem.

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:26.700
 And so much of effort is going into this, this thing is kind of re-solving these same

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:27.700
 problems again.

00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:34.620
 And yeah, I don't believe any like cloud wrapper companies and you have to like be intelligent

00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:37.700
 enough about a company and know enough about a company to know whether they really are

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:43.420
 just like this third layer cloud wrapper like planet scale, not a cloud wrapper.

00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:44.420
 They're an actual business.

00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:49.140
 They build actually great technology and they happen to use cloud resources for that.

00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:54.500
 But there's a difference like, there's so many startups that got funded in this kind

00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:56.580
 of like, I don't know why I say third layer.

00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:57.580
 What's the first layer?

00:46:57.580 --> 00:46:58.580
 I don't know.

00:46:58.580 --> 00:46:59.580
 I'm considering like the public clouds.

00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:00.580
 The second layer.

00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:02.260
 I don't know what the first layer is.

00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:04.020
 Just that's my terminology.

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:05.020
 Okay.

00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:06.020
 It's the third layer.

00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:09.860
 First layer is like electricity, atoms, whatever.

00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:15.860
 Yeah, the first layer is the layer that God works with and then the second layer is where

00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:16.860
 AWS comes in.

00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:17.860
 Okay.

00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:19.660
 And then the third layer is recent and versatile.

00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:20.660
 Okay.

00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:22.020
 And I just don't believe in those companies.

00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:23.300
 I just think they're all going to die.

00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:27.240
 What's funny is during this recent thing or like, because everyone was looking for post

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:32.260
 Mark alternatives and recent kept coming up, again, to me, it's extremely obvious when

00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:35.140
 there's accompanying this category, but apparently it's not super obvious.

00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:40.340
 But you know, who has a good nose for it is levels because levels is like what the fuck

00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:44.620
 like this just seems like another he calls it VC pump and dump like described in a bunch

00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:45.620
 of ways.

00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:46.620
 Yeah.

00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:47.620
 So he has a great nose for it.

00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:52.100
 But the thing that he's wrong about is he always frames it as the VCs are scamming you.

00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:54.380
 No, the VCs are losing money on this too.

00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:57.620
 I guarantee you they are going to end the end lose money on all of this.

00:47:57.620 --> 00:48:00.380
 These are not like super smart.

00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:02.500
 Like that's a one thing he's wrong about like there.

00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:03.500
 Yeah.

00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:04.500
 No one's making money.

00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:05.500
 All of these resources.

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:06.500
 Yeah.

00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:07.500
 Yes.

00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:08.500
 Exactly.

00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:09.500
 Yeah.

00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:10.500
 I'm with you.

00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:11.500
 Yeah.

00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:12.500
 So that was going on.

00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:17.220
 I've just been bugging me or it's been I'm just like tired of this same story over and

00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:18.220
 over again.

00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:19.220
 Yeah.

00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:21.660
 I haven't really been on the Internet since we did the whole American thing to do based

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:22.660
 switch over to PHP.

00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:23.660
 Is everyone right?

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:24.660
 Blair Vell now?

00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:25.660
 Did we do our job?

00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:28.540
 There are a lot of comments being like, oh man, I'm sure a lot of people checked it out

00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:33.340
 that they hadn't had it before and then they were like, oh, he looks like that.

00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:34.340
 Never mind.

00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:35.340
 I'm just kidding.

00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:36.340
 We love PHP.

00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:37.340
 PHP.

00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:38.340
 So great.

00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:39.340
 By artisan coffee.

00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:40.340
 Terminal dot shop.

00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:41.340
 You know what I'd like to do someday?

00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:49.340
 I'd like to like get so good at an ad read that like it seems like it's just a prerecorded

00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:52.060
 ad read, but I'm actually saying it exactly the same every time.

00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:53.540
 Does that make sense?

00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:54.540
 That'd be fun.

00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:57.300
 Like, and then maybe throw in one little change, like one little intonation.

00:48:57.300 --> 00:48:58.300
 Yeah.

00:48:58.300 --> 00:48:59.300
 Yeah.

00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:00.300
 Yeah.

00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:03.820
 Just like it could have just automated this could have just recorded it and played the

00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:04.820
 same thing.

00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:08.980
 But instead I'm going to say it every time, oh, let's take a break.

00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:17.580
 Hi, this is totally Adam, the host of the podcast reminding you in this sponsor read

00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:22.300
 that is clearly not a prerecorded bit that you should check out terminal coffee at terminal

00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:23.820
 dot shop.

00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:28.380
 Amazingly awesome products for developers brought to you by a group of talented, good

00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:34.500
 looking and humble heroes like Dax, Adam, the prime agent, Deedge and David to order

00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:36.260
 your next great coffee.

00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:40.340
 Please visit terminal dot shop.

00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:46.940
 I'm sorry, I just remembered I should do that sometimes.

00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:48.540
 That's what you do on podcast.

00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:50.100
 We're going to take a break for the podcast.

00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:51.100
 Like why do people take breaks?

00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:52.340
 Do they like need a break?

00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:53.340
 Do podcasts take breaks?

00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:54.340
 Oh, yeah.

00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:55.340
 I don't listen to podcast.

00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:56.340
 I just go listen to podcast.

00:49:56.340 --> 00:50:02.140
 I can tell you they do things on podcast that they don't actually believe me.

00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:03.140
 That's funny.

00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:05.500
 No, they're always like, we're going to take a break.

00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:06.500
 And then they just come right back.

00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:08.380
 And I'm like, did they have to pee?

00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:09.580
 Could they not have just cut that out?

00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:11.380
 Like I don't know what to break it.

00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:12.380
 Yeah.

00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:13.380
 Okay.

00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:14.380
 So the, the other thing.

00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:17.220
 Oh, what were you just talking about?

00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:18.220
 PHP, Laravel.

00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:19.220
 Oh, yeah.

00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:21.940
 So I've been doing a bunch of elixir.

00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:22.940
 I searched really.

00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:23.940
 By the way.

00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:24.940
 Oh, yeah.

00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:28.020
 Two days into it, a little hurt that you didn't notice.

00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:29.020
 I was in there.

00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:30.020
 50% of the screen.

00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:31.020
 You were, you were in there.

00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:32.020
 Okay.

00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:33.020
 Yeah.

00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:34.020
 Whatever.

00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:38.100
 You said something about tailwind, if I recall correctly.

00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:41.900
 I just find an opportunity to just show tailwind at every turn.

00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:43.380
 Well, I'm stuck using tailwind.

00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:46.460
 So I'm using elixir and phoenix and light.

00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:49.740
 I'm trying to use all that stuff for the thing I'm building.

00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:53.700
 But I had to post yesterday about this.

00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:55.180
 So I've used elixir for a very long time.

00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:56.340
 So I know how to write elixir.

00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:58.420
 I'm like very familiar with it.

00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:00.980
 I've done some pretty like deep things with it.

00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:05.500
 But it's my first time using like the batteries included like out of the box.

00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:06.500
 Same experience.

00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:07.500
 Yeah.

00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:08.500
 All that stuff.

00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:09.500
 Phoenix and all that.

00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:10.500
 Yeah.

00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:12.660
 And man, is it it is not a good onboarding experience.

00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:17.260
 Like there is just so much going on.

00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:19.060
 It uses like a crazy amount of macros.

00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:20.060
 So it's like really hard.

00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:23.900
 Macros basically let you invent magic in the language basically.

00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:24.900
 Yeah.

00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:25.900
 Yeah.

00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:26.900
 And it's just like so hard.

00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:28.740
 There's like, there's just so much thrown at you right away.

00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:30.260
 We're just spoiled with next chance.

00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:31.260
 Let's be honest.

00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:37.140
 I mean, the meta frameworks have really taken it to another level in JavaScript.

00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:38.140
 Sorry.

00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:39.140
 That was double sarcasm.

00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:40.140
 I don't know if everyone caught that.

00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:41.140
 Or was it triple?

00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:42.140
 It might have been triple.

00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:43.140
 I'm not sure.

00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:44.140
 Go ahead.

00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:49.020
 So I'm like, okay, what this, these frameworks, I think they don't have this competitive

00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:53.100
 pressure where they need to like really focus on this progressive disclosure thing.

00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:57.160
 So after using for two days, I'm like, oh, the way to do this is I have to go pick up

00:51:57.160 --> 00:51:59.900
 a book on Phoenix and by view and just read it.

00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:00.900
 It was just fine.

00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:05.740
 Like I've done that a bunch of times before, but that just not optimized for adoption.

00:52:05.740 --> 00:52:09.420
 Whereas if you look at something like, let's take a show, whatever, you know, they're entering

00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:11.660
 this like hyper competitor market.

00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:16.580
 They're way better about like here's like a really small starting point.

00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:19.700
 You can kind of get a handle of things and you kind of progressively add stuff and like

00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:20.700
 you kind of grow with it.

00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:21.940
 Is it just the competition?

00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:25.540
 It's just, there's so much more competition in JavaScript world because there's a framework

00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:26.540
 every week.

00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:27.540
 Is that the idea?

00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:30.900
 I think I'm, that's like my explanation, like, like to explain the differences.

00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:36.260
 I just think that we've got some like we've put in so much work to make it so SST is one

00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:37.260
 file.

00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:41.340
 Like that was so much work to like get it to that point, like years of refining and figuring

00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:42.340
 that out.

00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:44.900
 So you can start with a single file and then get more complex over time.

00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:50.260
 Yeah, and you start like a Phoenix app and it's like so many files.

00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:51.260
 And that's not even enough.

00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:54.220
 You like start that, then like run all these generators to generate even more files.

00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:56.780
 And it's just like, geez, so much though, not you.

00:52:56.780 --> 00:53:00.780
 And it's so the different, like such a different mindset than what we're like, what we like

00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:03.060
 spend all day thinking about.

00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:07.500
 So yeah, I think these frameworks would benefit a lot if they like rethought their process

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:12.580
 of, yeah, how can we make this feel like a natural progression where someone can tinker,

00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:17.100
 learn as opposed to feeling like, I like learn all this stuff up front and then actually

00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:18.100
 build my thing.

00:53:18.100 --> 00:53:22.100
 Because I'm like, as someone that's like, and like has usually extra a lot.

00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:27.540
 If I'm having a tough time getting through this, like it's a good sign that needs to

00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:28.540
 be improved.

00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:34.580
 I will say I do think the like MVC, MVVM, like if your framework still uses those paradigms,

00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:38.540
 I just don't think people have the attention span in 2024 to like use that.

00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:39.540
 You know what I mean?

00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:44.140
 The Phoenix app we had at Stat News is giant, giant Phoenix app.

00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:47.660
 The number of files in that app just boggles the mind.

00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:50.060
 I guess it's like our node modules.

00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:56.100
 It's like insanely verbose amount of files and it's all the MVC stuff, I guess.

00:53:56.100 --> 00:54:00.780
 And same, I saw people criticizing Laravel now that Laravel got a little more attention

00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:01.780
 for the same.

00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:03.060
 It's like, there's so many files.

00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:05.220
 I can't, I can't wrap my head around all this.

00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:08.740
 I guess JavaScript world, we've, we've paired it down.

00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:09.740
 There's still too many files.

00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:12.980
 I mean, there's too many like stupid dot files in your root directory for like all the

00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:15.540
 different tools, but well, you have to add those in.

00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:16.540
 Yeah.

00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:17.540
 You have to opt in.

00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:18.540
 I played people for that.

00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:19.540
 Yeah.

00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:24.420
 I played people for all this stacks, but I do think like the MVC thing is just, it's

00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:26.220
 too archaic feeling at this point.

00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:27.220
 I don't know.

00:54:27.220 --> 00:54:28.220
 Do you agree with that?

00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:29.220
 Or do you think it's like good pattern?

00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:30.220
 Do that?

00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:31.220
 I just don't know what the alternative is.

00:54:31.220 --> 00:54:33.420
 If you're doing a, well, what are we doing in JavaScript?

00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:35.060
 We've got an alternative.

00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:36.300
 We don't, we don't do MVC.

00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:38.860
 I don't, I just don't like do server render JavaScript.

00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:42.300
 So like I just don't mean driven design, right?

00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:43.300
 Yeah.

00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:47.420
 To be honest, I learned all the domain driven design stuff from Elixir like this, the Phoenix

00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:50.940
 documentation on context is where like a couple of all the stuff I do in JavaScript.

00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:51.940
 Yeah.

00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:52.940
 I don't know when I'm talking about that.

00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:53.940
 Yeah.

00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:55.500
 I'm okay with the final set of files being large.

00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:57.180
 I think I'm technically okay with that.

00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:58.940
 I understand there's a lot of capability in there.

00:54:58.940 --> 00:54:59.940
 And that's why it's all there.

00:54:59.940 --> 00:55:03.220
 Like if you say there's too many files, you're going to say, well, your framework doesn't

00:55:03.220 --> 00:55:07.100
 can't do X, Y, Z things, so fine, I'll give them that those files are necessary.

00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:14.060
 I just want to like get there over time, like I want to be like, okay, I want to do events

00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:15.060
 now.

00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:16.340
 And then I start to add the files later to events.

00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:20.860
 I don't want it's all like bootstrapped and set up and like kind of confusing me when

00:55:20.860 --> 00:55:21.860
 I'm not interested.

00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:22.860
 Yeah.

00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:23.860
 Like 90% of the stuff that's there.

00:55:23.860 --> 00:55:31.500
 So to me, it's purely an onboarding initial adoption experience thing, whether it's not

00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:36.100
 too many files in there, I think that's kind of subjective because people will argue, well,

00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:37.100
 I need those.

00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:38.100
 That's so reasonable, Dax.

00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:39.580
 I'm going to be so reasonable.

00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:42.020
 I'm just trying to be inflammatory.

00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:47.460
 I'm just trying to not have annoying people reply to you with annoying thoughts.

00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:49.020
 That's really all it comes down to.

00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:53.100
 People have really stupid surface level replies to things.

00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:56.420
 And if I'm not specific, I will get those.

00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:57.420
 It's inevitable.

00:55:57.420 --> 00:55:58.420
 I'll get them anyway.

00:55:58.420 --> 00:55:59.420
 Yeah.

00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:00.940
 I feel like you became too much of a character on the internet.

00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:02.180
 You got to lay a little lower.

00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:06.860
 You became a little too like people want to, they want to say things to you in reply.

00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:08.940
 People don't really care to say anything to reply.

00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:13.140
 Maybe because I just talk about like eating plants and jiu-jitsu and stuff and they don't

00:56:13.140 --> 00:56:14.340
 have anything to say.

00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:18.040
 But I've laid low enough that I don't really get the angry replies.

00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:20.380
 And if I do, I guess I don't notice because I'm not on Twitter.

00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:21.380
 I don't know.

00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:24.140
 Well, I'm currently thinking about going in one of two directions.

00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:25.540
 Like, yeah, so that's one option.

00:56:25.540 --> 00:56:26.540
 We described.

00:56:26.540 --> 00:56:31.020
 But then when I think about like DHH and levels, I'm like, they're like way more harder than

00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:32.020
 I am.

00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:33.020
 Yeah.

00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:34.020
 And I'm like, should I just do that?

00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:35.020
 Lean in.

00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:36.020
 Maybe.

00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:37.020
 Can't tell.

00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:38.020
 Maybe.

00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:39.020
 Who knows?

00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:40.020
 All right.

00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:41.020
 I got to get off here.

00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:42.020
 I'm sorry.

00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:43.020
 I'm staring it.

00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:44.020
 I've gotten distracted.

00:56:44.020 --> 00:56:45.020
 Staring it.

00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:46.020
 The waiting for review on the app thing.

00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:47.020
 And I have to make changes to the web thing because our thing uses the web.

00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:49.180
 And if I don't make those changes, it's not really ready.

00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:50.180
 Just go, go, go.

00:56:50.180 --> 00:56:51.180
 You know?

00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:52.180
 Okay.

00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:55.900
 Well, before you go for our event in New York, we need to figure out some stuff with you.

00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:56.900
 Oh, yeah.

00:56:56.900 --> 00:56:57.900
 Let's figure it out.

00:56:57.900 --> 00:56:58.900
 Let's do it now.

00:56:58.900 --> 00:56:59.900
 No, no, no, not right now.

00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:00.900
 Okay.

00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:03.340
 Me and Liz need to talk to you a bunch about a few things because there's like the production

00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:06.340
 of it itself is going to be a little tricky.

00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:09.860
 So I just want to like talk through that to make sure that love it.

00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:12.780
 We're going to have some staff at the venue.

00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:13.780
 Ooh.

00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:14.780
 Staff.

00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:15.780
 Like a butler.

00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:16.780
 Like a nature D.

00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:17.780
 I don't know.

00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:18.780
 What are staff?

00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:21.340
 No, like like tech people like tech.

00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:22.340
 Oh.

00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:23.340
 Because they have like.

00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:24.340
 Nice.

00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:25.340
 I like this idea.

00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:26.340
 Wait, are we just doing an iPhone though?

00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:27.340
 Can we just record everything on iPhone now?

00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:28.340
 Is that what we decided?

00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:29.340
 Well, I'm getting my new iPhone tomorrow.

00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:30.340
 That makes sense.

00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:31.340
 There you go.

00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:32.340
 We'll just record on your new iPhone.

00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:33.340
 No, no, no, no, no.

00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:34.340
 No, no, no.

00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:35.340
 No, no, no, no, no.

00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:36.340
 Cameras.

00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:37.340
 DSLR.

00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:38.340
 The whole thing.

00:57:38.340 --> 00:57:39.340
 I don't know.

00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:40.340
 We need to talk about it.

00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:41.340
 I'll talk.

00:57:41.340 --> 00:57:42.340
 Yeah.

00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:43.340
 Let's talk.

00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:48.460
 You and your people will talk to me and my people can begin big and bottle be my people

00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:53.340
 and you and Liz or your people have a DM with the with all you guys that nobody's replied

00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:54.340
 to.

00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:55.340
 Yeah.

00:57:55.340 --> 00:57:56.340
 I hearted it or something.

00:57:56.340 --> 00:57:58.340
 I did something.

00:57:58.340 --> 00:58:00.340
 I don't even think vegan checks that slack.

00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:01.340
 So I don't know how we're going to.

00:58:01.340 --> 00:58:02.340
 Maybe not.

00:58:02.340 --> 00:58:03.340
 I don't even know if he's confirmed going like it's.

00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:05.340
 It's going to be a message.

00:58:05.340 --> 00:58:07.340
 I got to find that message.

00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:08.340
 Was that in?

00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:09.340
 Oh, it's in slack.

00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:10.340
 I forget.

00:58:10.340 --> 00:58:11.340
 We're a slack company now.

00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:12.340
 Yeah.

00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:13.340
 Okay.

00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:14.340
 Yeah.

00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:15.340
 I'm going to say something in it right now.

00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:16.340
 You start doing real things.

00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:17.340
 You have to be a slack company.

00:58:17.340 --> 00:58:18.340
 Yeah.

00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:19.340
 We're doing real things.

00:58:19.340 --> 00:58:20.340
 Real things.

00:58:20.340 --> 00:58:21.340
 I thumbs up and hearted it.

00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:22.340
 Thank you very much.

00:58:22.340 --> 00:58:23.340
 I'm good.

00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:24.340
 Thanks, Dax.

00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:25.340
 Thanks for the thumbs up and the heart.

00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:26.340
 You're welcome.

00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:28.340
 There's more where that came from.

00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:29.940
 More laughy faces.

00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:32.340
 I'm crying laughing faces.

00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:34.340
 No, I do this a lot.

00:58:34.340 --> 00:58:35.340
 Okay.

00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:36.340
 All right.

00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:37.340
 See you.

00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:38.340
 Yeah.

00:58:52.340 --> 00:59:02.340
